            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>SINCE we may Daily obſerve, That the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Foxes, both Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, Prieſts, and Layity, do lay out the utmoſt of their ſtrength and Policy, to introduce their curſed Principles and Practices into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it concerns every Man to be upon his Guard, and to endeavour as much as poſſible to ſecure and forewarn all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of the danger of the return of that medly of Non-ſence, Blaſphemy, and Slavery; And young Perſons eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:107440:4"/> ought to be truly informed thereof, ſince the deſign of theſe Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> is to debauch the Youth of this Nation; and therefore upon all occaſions you ſhall hear them vilifying all Religion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the Holy Scriptures; there being none fitter to be <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks (as they non-ſenſically call themſelves) than Atheiſts; becauſe they find little or no difference between the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, (if it deſerves that Name) and none at all, ſince Treaſons, Rebellions, Murders, Rapes, Burnings, and all manner of the moſt Horrid Cruelties Hell it ſelf can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, are ſo far from being Crimes or Sins, that they are many times counted meritorious, and a Man ſhall deſerve Heaven for committing them, according to the Doctrine of that Church; there being no ſin unpardonable, but that which they falſly call <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God according to the Scriptures; and for this it is that they would have murdered our Gracious Sovereign, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Land into Blood, Slaughter, and
<pb facs="tcp:107440:4"/> Confuſion: For this they would have overthrown our Religion, enſlaved our Conſciences, or elſe have burnt our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Aſhes, as they did our Anceſtors; It is difficult to give a draught of this bloody Beaſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> it would be a horrid ſight to draw him in his full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, yet take a ſhort view of him, ſo as to tremble at the thoughts of what others have ſuffered, and what he yet hopes to inflict upon us, if Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence prevent him not; though no doubt but the Almighty will ſave and deliver us out of his Hands: His Eyes are Flames that have conſumed the Bodies of many Thouſand Martyrs, His Mouth is like Hell gaping for his Prey; Blood guſhes out of his Jaws like Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, his bloody Tuſkes are the Racks and tormenting Engines wherewith he grinds the Bones of Gods Saints, His Tail is Armed with the ſtings of Scorpions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he laſhes Kings and Kingdoms; from his Throat he belches forth Curſes and Excommunications, and denounces
<pb facs="tcp:107440:5"/> Judgments and Death upon all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, It is this Monster of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and Cruelty that the Slaves of <hi>Rome</hi> endeavour to advance in all places where they have Power and Authority, and by this you may Judge of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Religion; by theſe evil Fruits you may Judge of the Tree, and what Spirit they are of; their hopes are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, and their confidence mighty, but we truſt Heaven will blaſt their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and overthrow their Machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet ſave his People.</p>
            <p>So that we may have cauſe to bleſs the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and to praiſe him in the Congregation; Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have no diſagreement among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, but let us as one Man by all juſtifiable and lawful methods, in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places and Stations, oppoſe this armed Beaſt of Perſecution; And let us inſtruct our Youth both in their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practices, that ſo they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void and fly from them, as from that which will certainly ruine Soul, Body,
<pb facs="tcp:107440:5"/> and Eſtate for ever. This is the deſign of this little Book, which will give a brief Account of the Miſchiefs and Villanies committed by that <hi>Man of ſin</hi> upon the Servants of God, ever ſince he appeared in the World, the like of which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acted by Heathens, Turks, or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels; and ſince they make ſo ill uſe of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures upon many accounts; I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to draw in Picture ſome ſhort strokes of the variety of their Tortures, practiſed upon Proteſtants, a Volume not being able to contain the whole of their Horrid Maſſacres, and Inhumane tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Here are likewiſe Rules for teaching young people to read Engliſh, ſo that this may ſerve instead of any other Book of this kind; and youth may at the ſame time reap both profit and Delight; and thereby learn in time to read their Bible, that Great Enemy to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church, and which they formerly have, and would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain burn as well as our Bodies, if it were in their power. Therefore let us Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb facs="tcp:107440:6"/> in the words of the Royal Pſalmiſt, Pſalm <hi>5. Deſtroy thou the wicked and miſchievous Perſecutors O God, let them fall by their own Councils, Caſt them out in the multitude of their Tranſgreſſions, for they have rebelled againſt thee, but let all thoſe who put their Truſt in thee rejoyce, let them ever ſhout for Joy, becauſe thou defendeſt them, let them alſo that love thy Name be Joyful in thee; For thou O Lord wilt bleſs the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, with favour wilt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs him as with a Shield. Amen.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A Vowel hath of it ſelf a compleat ſound as for example; The Eyes of (A) wiſe Man are in his Head (I) wiſh we had many ſuch; (O) How happy might we be?</p>
               <p>Some obſerve that there are Seven mute or dumb Letters, and they are B, C, D, G, P, Q, T. So called becauſe they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Vowel E at the end to help their ſound; Their are Eight half Vowels; F, L, M, N, R, S, X, Z. All which begin their ſound with an E, and end in themſelves; The ſeveral Letters are ſometimes thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, <hi>b f m p ph w,</hi> are Lip-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants, becauſe the lips are neceſſary in their pronunciation; <hi>Ce, ch, ge, je, ſ, ſh, z.</hi> are Teeth Conſonants, <hi>d, l, u, r, t, th,</hi> are Tongue Conſonants; <hi>C, g, k, q, x,</hi> are Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Conſonants; <hi>Gh, h, ug, y,</hi> are Throat Conſonants.</p>
               <p>If Conſonants are without Vowels they will make no ſound at all; <hi>gl, ſs, ch, ſt, dr, uk, gd, mſt;</hi> but if a Vowel be added to each of them, then they make a perfect
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107440:9"/> ſound, as by adding <hi>a</hi> to the firſt word makes it <hi>glaſs, e</hi> to the ſecond <hi>cheſt; i</hi> to the third <hi>drink; o</hi> to the fourth <hi>God, u</hi> to the Fifth <hi>muſt;</hi> If a Conſonant happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Vowels, it is uſually joyned to the latter, as <hi>de-fe-ba-niſh, ba-ſon, de-ſire;</hi> If a double Conſonant happen in the midſt of a word, one of the Letters is joyned to the firſt ſyllable, and the other to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as <hi>kil-ling, ſuf-fice, ſuc-ceſs;</hi> And ſo it is likewiſe if two Conſonants come between two Vowels; as <hi>tram-ple, ſhort-ly, ob-ſcure, per-fect;</hi> But if three Conſonants which are proper to begin a word come between two Vowels, then the Conſonant muſt not be ſeparated, but joyned to the next Vowel, as <hi>di-ſtract-ed,</hi> not <hi>diſ-tracted,</hi> nor <hi>diſt-racted,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſtr</hi> are proper to begin a Word. The Conſonants following of two Letters may likewiſe begin words, <hi>cr, dr, dw, fl, fr, kn, pl, pr, ſc, ſh, ſl, ſp, ſt, ſk, ſm, ſn, ſq, ſw, th, tr, tw, wh, wr.</hi> There are Conſonants of three Letters alſo to begin words; as <hi>ſcr, pher, ſtr, ſqu, ſpr, ſhr, thr, thw, ſpl.</hi>

               <p>There are ſome who reckon Eighteen Dipthongs in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, but uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we count Fourteen, Eight of which are called <hi>proper</hi> Dipthongs; as <hi>ai, ei, oi, au, eu, ou, ee, oo:</hi> Six are named <hi>improper, ay, ey, oy,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107440:10"/> aw, ew, ow;</hi> Now though they differ not much in ſound, yet they do very much in writing, for the proper Dipthongs are to be uſed in the beginning and middle, as in <hi>Oiſter, fair, Air, neither,</hi> but when you have the ſame in the ends of words, you muſt write; <hi>ay, ey, oy,</hi> as <hi>prey; may, joy.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is called the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> from a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proteſtation of ſeveral Princes and Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> againſt the errors and Uſurpations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but yet it is no new Doctrine brought into the VVorld, but the truth of Chriſtianity, Confeſſed, Aſſerted, and purged from the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Popery,</hi> and hath the very ſame grounds to prove the Truth thereof, which the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf hath.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How do you prove that the</hi> Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>profeſſed at this day is the pure and Ancient Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe of its exact Conformity to the Scriptures, and the genuine and clear ſenſe thereof. 2. In that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> is the very ſame, and exactly agrees with the Faith of the Chriſtian Church in the firſt three hundred years after the death of our Saviour. 3. From the confeſſion of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, who own that there have been ſome in all Ages, even in the darkeſt times of <hi>Popery,</hi> who have Owned, Aſſerted, and Died in Defence of the ſame Doctrines which we now profeſs, as the <hi>Waldenſes, Albingenſes, Berengatians,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Hath not the Romiſh Church, the Decrees, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Councils and the Pope himſelf as their Head, to prove the Truth and Certainty of their Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though they boaſt very much of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity yet. 1. They never were agreed, nor are ever like to agree who this Infallible Judge is, whether in a General Council, or the Pope himſelf, 2. They have no Rational Certainty of what they believe, ſince they willfully neglect the Holy Scriptures, and with a Biind Obedience intruſt their Souls with thoſe Men whoſe Credit and Teſtimony a Man would hardly truſt with a Sum of Money without better Security. 3. They have no Bible, nor other Authentick Record
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107440:27"/> to prove their Religion, but a Maſs of dead Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have no Voice, nor Sound to be underſtood, untill the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy put a ſenſe upon them; So that a Man can hardly embrace <hi>Popery,</hi> except he firſt turn <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> yea, quit all his Religion and Reaſon at once.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But do not the</hi> Papiſts <hi>damn all the World but themſelves, confidently affirming that</hi> Rome <hi>is the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Apoſtolick Church, <hi>out of which there is no ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their confidence is not at all to be wondred at, ſince it is one of the greateſt Arguments they uſe, to prove the moſt ridiculous Aſſertions, but that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church can have no poſſible claim to their being only ſaved, is unanſwerable from theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 1. Becauſe we know of no Church which conſiſteth of all Chriſtians Subjected to one Humane Head, nor do we read that our Subjection to the Pope is made a condition of Salvation. 2. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that in the Apoſtles time, and for divers Ages ſince, there was a Chriſtian Catholick Church which had no dependence upon the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> 3. There are a greater number in the World who embrace and profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, and have no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>Rome,</hi> than there are <hi>Papiſts.</hi> 4. It is the prerogative of Jeſus Chriſt alone to be Head of his Church, for as there is one Faith, and <hi>one Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ,</hi> ſo there is but <hi>one body, which is his Church,</hi> united to him as her head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.6.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What are ſome of thoſe Errors brought in by the Pope and his Clergy, which occaſioned the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>departure from their Communion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There were ſeveral Errors and Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Introduced, both in Doctrine and Diſcipline, one of their Doctrines was that of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which they affirm is a place next door to <hi>Hell,</hi> where the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107440:28"/> are as extream as thoſe of <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf, but not eternal; in this place they ſay the Souls of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are purged, ſome for a hundred, ſome for five hundred, or a Thouſand years, till they are delivered by the Prayers, Maſſes, Popes Pardons, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the Money of their Friends or Relations.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What ſay the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>to this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They ſay it is Blaſphemy to believe that Men are purged from ſins in this place, ſince the bloud of Chriſt is the only purgatory for our Sins. Beſides, there is no ground in Scripture for any ſuch belief. St. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. <hi>In Hell he lift up his Eyes being in Torment,</hi> &amp;c. St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.12. <hi>They ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, &amp;c. <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven, but the other ſhall be caſt into utter Darkneſs, where ſhall be Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Mark 26.16: <hi>He that believeth ſhall be Saved, and he that believeth not ſhall be Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What other Errors do they maintain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation; for they ſay that in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, Jeſus Chriſt is corporally preſent, and that there is a change of the Subſtance of the bread and wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the natural body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What anſwer the Proteſtants?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That this Doctrine is contrary to many plain Teſtimonies of Scripture, it overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occaſion to very groſs Idolatry, and great Superſtition; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it contains a multitude of abſurdities and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: For 1. Then muſt our bleſſed Saviour hold himſelf in his own hands, yea devour and eat up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yet ſtill ſit whole and entire at the Table with his Diſciples. 2. The body of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be in a Thouſand places at the ſame time. 3. His whole body muſt be in the mouth of every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant at once. 4. His whole body muſt be leſs in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity than the leaſt Limb of his body. 5. His body muſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107440:28"/> at the ſame time be broken and unbroken, and muſt at the ſame time aſcend and deſcend; and laſtly, muſt be ſubject to putrefaction, and many other Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And therefore thoſe words. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are to be underſtood, that this doth ſignify and repreſent my body; and upon the ſame account Chriſt is called a <hi>Rock,</hi> a <hi>Door, a Vine,</hi> and yet none can be ſo ſenſleſs to think that Jeſus Chriſt was turned into any of theſe.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat other Errors are they charged with?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That the Scripture ought not to be ſet forth in the Common Tongue; but that it is dangerous for the people to read the Bible, leſt they fall into Hereſie.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>What do the Proteſtants anſwer to this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the true Reaſon of this is becauſe if they ſuffer the People to read the Scripture, it would make them abhor the Popiſh Religion, as being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely contrary thereunto. For the Scriptures exhort all to be diligent Readers thereof, and our Saviour ſaith, vvhat ſay the Prophets and Apoſtles concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this? <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 5.39. <hi>Seek ye the Book of the Lord and read,</hi> Iſa. 34.16. <hi>They were more noble in that they ſearched the Scriptures dayly,</hi> Acts 17.11. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them,</hi> Luke 16.29. <hi>Let the word of God dwell richly in you,</hi> Col. 3.16. <hi>Take the ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,</hi> Eph. 6.17. <hi>From a child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. <hi>Except you utter Words eaſy to be underſtood, how ſhall it be known what is ſpoken?</hi> 1 Cor. 14.9, 16.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>What other erroneous Doctrines do the Papiſts hold?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The praying to Angels, to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Apoſtles and Saints departed.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat ſay the Proteſtants to it?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They ſay, That the Papiſts by praying in that manner, do give to the Angels and Saints departed the higheſt religious Worſhip and Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is poſſible, and ſo are guilty of fearful Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107440:29"/> and that we ought to go to God in the mediation of Chriſt alone; neither have we any ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Saints in Heaven know our particular Perſons, wants, neceſſities or deſires; and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems contrary to all this; <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> Pſal. 50.15. <hi>Say, Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Luke 11.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only,</hi> Mat. 4.10. <hi>Let no man beguile you into a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humility and worſhipping of Angels,</hi> Col. 2.18. <hi>There is one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>Through him we have acceſs unto the Father,</hi> Eph. 2.18. <hi>Do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Col. 3.17. <hi>VVhatſoever you ſhall ask in my name I will do it,</hi> John. 14 3. <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father, though</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>be ignorant of us, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>know us not,</hi> Iſ. 63.13. <hi>Thou ſendeſt man away, his Sons come to Honour, and he knows it not, they are brought low, but he perceives it not.</hi> Job. 14.21.

            <p>Queſt. <hi>Do not the Papiſts affirm that we ought to pray for the dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes but the Proteſtants anſwer, They that dye in the Lord need not our prayers, and they that dye in their ſins can have no benefit by them; and that the reaſon, why the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts uphold this Error is, becauſe they get ſo much money by it. Laſtly; we have no Command from God; no promiſe to be heard; no Example in Scripture for praying for the dead, or praying to Saints, Read 2 Sam. 12.21. <hi>Now the Child is dead, why ſhould I faſt and pray.

            <p>Qu. <hi>Do the Papiſts hold that all that dye without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm are undoubtedly damned, and ſhut out of Heaven?</hi>

            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:107440:29"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, But Proteſtants ſay that is falſe; for then 1. The Penitent Thief could not be ſaved; contrary to that of St. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. 2.

I <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you with vvater;</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. <hi>Can any forbid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that theſe ſhould not be baptized?</hi> But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſe Salt, Oyle, Spittle and many other Superſtitions and Additions, which they have made to the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt in Baptiſme. King <hi>James</hi> of Famous Memory, in his Apology, hath theſe Words, <hi>The Queen my Mother at my</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>although I was</hi> Baptiſed <hi>by a Popiſh Arch-biſhop, ſent him word to forbear to uſe the Spittle in my</hi> Baptiſm; which was obeyed, <hi>it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Filthy and Apiſh Trick: Her own words were,</hi> That ſhe would not have a <hi>Pocky Prieſt</hi> to ſpit in her Childs Mouth.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What do the</hi> Papiſts <hi>mean by the Maſs, which they ſo often talk of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the ſame which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> call the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> call it the <hi>Maſs,</hi> thereby intimating that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is made a Sacrifice and offered up to God, which as it is uſed by them is both Vain and Idolatrous. 1. Becauſe by the Death of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, who was Sacrificed for our Sins, Divine Juſtice is ſufficiently ſatisfied, and the Sinner who returns and Repents is fully ſecured as to his everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting State. Heb. 10.12. <hi>This man after he had offered one Sacrifice for Sins for ever, ſate down at the Right-hand of God.</hi> 2. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> Worſhip their Maſs not only as God, but truſt in it for Salvation inſtead of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:107440:30"/> our Saviour: Neither doth it excuſe them to ſay, that they worſhip not the Bread, or a breaden God, but Jeſus Chriſt, whom they ſuppoſe to be preſent; for this Argument cannot free them from Idolatry, no more than it will the Heathen Idolaters, who though they worſhipped the Sun, yet ſuppoſed it to be God; and ſo they did <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whom they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped: And therefore if Papiſts be not Idolaters, there never were any ſuch in the world.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Are theſe all the Points wherein the Papiſts and Proteſtants differ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, for a Volume would hardly contain the Fopperies of that Apoſtate Church; as, denying the Cup in the Lords Supper to the people, Pardons, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, Pilgrimages, and Jubilees; their ſeven Sacraments, inſtead of two appointed by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; forbidding Prieſts to marry, Juſtification by Works, Merit, Equivocation, and abundance more; which if truly underſtood, would make every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant abhor both their Church and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But is the Apoſtacy of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſuch, as there is no ſafe union with her, or being ſaved in that Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If <hi>Rome</hi> be that ſpiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. as it is there very plain and evident, then are we abſolutely commanded to <hi>come out of her, leſt being partakers of her ſins, we be partakers of her plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But though the</hi> Roman <hi>Church in her Doctrine be directly contrary to Scripture, yet how can all this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that the Pope is the</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>ſo expreſly foretold in</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.4.?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To reſolve this queſtion, let us conſider: 1. That the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture hath been very exact in pointing out Antichriſt by ſuch notorious marks and characters, as after-Ages might eaſily
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107440:30"/> know him if they do not wilfully ſhut their eyes. 2. Unleſs we deny our Senſes, (as Papiſts do in many things) we cannot be ignorant that the Popiſh Church clearly anſwers all thoſe marks which are given of him in Scripture, even him, <hi>whoſe coming ſhall be after the working of Satan, with all power, ſigns and lying wonders, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats, which God hath appointed to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thanksgiving; who ſitteth in the Temple of God, and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God; who bewitcheth the Kings of the Earth with his Inchantments, and is drunk with the blood of the Martyrs of Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> yea, whoſe Traffick and Merchandize is not only ſilver and gold, but <hi>the Souls of men, Rev.</hi> 18.13.3. This Myſtery began to work in the time of the Apoſtles, and he who for a time did withhold his coming, (that is the Heathen Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi>) hath been long ſince taken out of the way: And 4. It is undeniable, that this Adverſary can be no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon, or of a ſhort continuance, but is a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Body or Kingdome, united in one Supreme Head, and with a ſucceſſion for many Ages. 5. It is apparent, that theſe expreſs characters of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, can be applied to no other Enemy of Jeſus Chriſt or his Church, under the New Teſtament, either <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Mahometan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But it is ſaid of Antichriſt</hi> that the Lord will conſume him by the breath of his mouth; <hi>and how can this be applied to the Pope or Church of</hi> Rome?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We know that the Fall of Antichriſt muſt be by degrees, as his Riſe was, and not all at once. 2. How have theſe laſt Ages of the World been cleared from Antichriſtian darkneſs, in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But do we not ſee Popery prevail now in a more
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107440:31"/> than ordinary way in ſeveral Countries where the Goſpel has been clearly preached?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is not ſo ſtrange, if we conſider: 1. That where the truth is not received in love, God doth many times give up men to ſtrong deluſions, to believe lies. 2. Obſerve, that ſuch as imbrace Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery do not do it from Principles of Reaſon or Conſcience, but it is the viſible effect of a Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Age, and from an unuſual growth of Atheiſme and Ignorance: for it is not to be admired, if thoſe who never really had any Religion, Eſpouſe any Religion that may ſerve their Intereſt or Luſt. 3. There is no ſuch great ſlavery exerciſed over the body under <hi>Turkiſh</hi> bondage, as there is over the Reaſons and Conſciences of men under the Popiſh Yoak; ſo that they have no way to be convinced of their Errors, ſince they muſt not ſee with their own eyes; the moſt clear diſcoveries of truth that can be made to them, either in the Scriptures, or any other Books. Laſtly, though Popery ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, yet it's clear, that they get but little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereby, and it ſeems only to make way for its utter ruine and deſtruction: So that if the Pope be not Antichriſt, yet we may challenge Antichriſt to do worſe and wickeder things than he.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Certainly there can be but little encouragement for men to turn Papiſts, if they rightly underſtand what Popery is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No queſtion but there is great blindneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their minds, ſince the whole frame of it is but the driving on of a Politick Intereſt: They ſhut up the Scripture to keep the people in the dark, their Religion not being able to endure the light; they ſet up an Infallibility to hold them under a blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; they pick their pockets by their Doctrines of Merit and Purgatory; yea, notwithſtanding their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107440:31"/> high pretences to Charity, it is ſuch a Religion, that no man can be damn'd except he be poor, neither can any rich man miſcarry, if he will part with his Silver to ſave his Soul; ſo that it is fitted for a moſt wicked and licentious life, ſince men may ſin at the higheſt rate, and not endanger their ſouls; for if they have money, the Popes Pardon clears them from the greateſt Villanies; ſo that though they are never ſo guilty, they can with their laſt breath ſolemnly call God to witneſs, <hi>that they are as Innocent as the Child unborn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Since the Popiſh Religion is ſuch a compound of Humane Policy, and framed to make men depend upon the Pope, and be ſubject to his power, though againſt their Sovereigns Intereſt, we may wonder that ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do with one conſent joyn their power to ſupport his Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This indeed ſeems to be a very ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation, and we can give no other reaſon for it, but that it is the ſecret Judgment of God to give them thus up, according to what was foretold in Rev. 17.17. <hi>For God hath put it into their heart to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and give their power to the Beaſt, until the words of God be fulfilled:</hi> for elſe there is nothing more deſtructive to their Power and Intereſt, than ſuch a <hi>Spiritual Sovereign</hi> as the Pope pretends to be.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>How doth it appear that the Popiſh Religion is ſo deſtructive to the power of Princes, and the Intereſt of their Kingdomes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is undeniably clear from their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Principles. 1. They aſſert, that the Pope may dethrone Kings, and give their Kingdomes to others; that he can abſolve and free their Subjects from all Duty and Allegiance to them, yea, he can bind and looſe their Conſciences at his own pleaſure. 2. It is ſuch a Religion as expreſly frees and exempts
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107440:32"/> all Eccleſiaſtical perſons from the Laws of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Prince, ſo that they cannot be judged for the moſt horrid and notorious Crimes that can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by them. 3. It makes the Princes and Rulers of the world, to execute with a blind obedience whatſoever the Pope commands them, not leaving them the liberty to judge whether it be right or wrong. 4. It ſtrikes at the very Foundation of all Religion and Piety (which is the greateſt ſecurity to Government, and the ſtrongeſt obligation to all Civil and Moral Duties) for if a man commit the moſt horrid acts of wickedneſs, ſuch as Murther, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Inceſt, Rape, Sodomy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet an ordinary Prieſt, by the Almighty power of the Pope, can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with them all, the price of them being rated and appointed, which being paid, the Prieſt can give full pardon and abſolution for the ſame. 5. It is a Religion that expreſly teaches, that a man is not bound to repent preſently of the moſt heinous ſin, it being ſufficient if it be done before the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life. 6. It deſtroys truth, righteouſneſs and honeſty among men, ſince it allows and warrants Equivocation and Perjury both in Oaths and words; and that a man may ſwear in ſuch doubtful terms as may be directly contrary to the intent of him that gives the Oath, whereby an Oath cannot be an end of Controverſie. Laſtly, it is a Religion which in its Principles is deſtructive to Humane Society, for it triumphs, delights and glories in thoſe monſtrous Prodigies of miſchief, Blood and Cruelty, which we would think Humane Nature would tremble at, and which ſeem rather to have been acted by Devils transformed into the ſhape of men, than by any who have the leaſt pretence to the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; witneſs the Maſſacres of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the bloody Perſecutions in the, <hi>Netherlands, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107440:32"/> Spain, Piedmont,</hi> and moſt Countries in <hi>Europe.</hi> Therefore from ſuch a Religion, and all the curſed effects thereof, let us beſeech Almighty God to deliver us and our Poſterity for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>ABOUT Five Hundred Years after the death of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, one <hi>Phocas</hi> (who had Murdered his Maſter <hi>Mauritius</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and his Children) firſt Advanced the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be Univerſal Biſhops and Heads of the Church; at which time they were endowed with theſe large Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and Donations which they call St. <hi>Peters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,</hi> and which they falſly aſſert to be the Gift of <hi>Conſtantine the Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> growing Great, Mighty, Rich, and Proud, at once loſt its Humility and Purity of Religion, and aſſumed Politick and Tyrannical Principles, which cauſed her Defiled hands to lay afide the Sword of the Spirit, and to make uſe of the Temporal Sword, which ſhe uſed to the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Murthering of divers Kings, Princes, and Emperours.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For after they had once taſted the Sweetneſs of Wealth, Eaſe and Proſperity, the Popes began to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107440:34"/> ſwell in Pride and Pomp, and the more they Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in this World, the more the holy Spirit of God forſook them, ſo that in a ſhort time thoſe Biſhops who were Poor, Mean, indigent, perſecuted, and wanting all things, began to Triumph over <hi>Princes,</hi> to tread upon the Necks of <hi>Emperours,</hi> and to bring the heads of Kings under their Uſurped Authority. They were carryed upon Mens Shoulders in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Magnificence, as if the earth were not good enough to bear them; they were honoured as Gods on earth; and Sovereign <hi>Princes, Dukes,</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> &amp;c. went Bare-headed before them. And not only ſo, but through their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> they grew ſo great Apoſtates from Chriſtians, that of being <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted</hi> they became <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of others, and at laſt were ſo Great enemies to God and Religion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> may now be juſtly Reckoned and Accounted the <hi>Antichriſt or Man of Sin,</hi> ſo long before ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 2.2.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This pride and inſolency of the Pope and his Clergy, appeared in ſeveral Inſtances which might, be given of it, but out of the Multitude we ſhall only Collect ſome few, to ſhew what Slavery and Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage both Princes and people were formerly ſubject to, under this <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Yoke. About the Year 1158. <hi>Frederick Emperour</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> Marching into <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope hearing of it went with his Clergy to meet him; As ſoon as the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſaw the <hi>Pope,</hi> he Alighted from his Horſe to receive him, and held the Popes Stirrup while he Alighted alſo, but it ſeems he miſtook the Left Stirrup inſtead of the Right, at which the Pope ſeemed to be very much offended, which the Emperour obſerving, he ſmilingly told the Pope, <hi>That he deſired to be excuſed, ſince he was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to hold Stirrups,</hi> with which acknowledgment the Pope ſeemed to be ſatisfied. After this there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107440:34"/> ſome difference between the Pope and the Emperour, whereupon the Pope curſeth him, and ſends his Letters out againſt him to all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> declaring, that he was an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſon, and ought to be avoided, and caſt out of all Chriſtian company: He likewiſe ſtirred up his Subjects in Rebellion againſt him. The Emperour then marched to <hi>Rome</hi> to chaſtiſe his pride, but the Pope fled to <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſend him to <hi>Frederick,</hi> refuſed it; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Emperour ſent his Son <hi>Otho</hi> againſt him, with men and Ships very well furniſhed, but withal, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him by no means to attempt any thing againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> till he himſelf came: But the young man being full of heat, and deſire of glory, ventured to ingage the Enemy, and was by them overthrown, and himſelf taken priſoner. Upon this misfortune, the compaſſionate Father, to releaſe his Son from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and miſery, was forced to ſubmit to whatever Conditions of Peace the Pope ſhould demand; whereby it was at laſt agreed, that the Emperour ſhould come into S. <hi>Marks</hi> Church at <hi>Venice,</hi> and there kneeling down at the Popes feet, he ſhould receive Abſolution and forgiveneſs. This the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour performed; and the proud Pope ſetting his foot upon the Emperours Neck, ſaid that verſe in the Pſalm, <hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon Lyons and Adders, the young Lyon and the Dragon ſhalt thou trample under foot;</hi> which the Pope applied to the Emperour; but the Emperour anſwered, <hi>Not to thee, but to</hi> Peter <hi>this power is given.</hi> The Pope replied, <hi>Both to me, and to Peter.</hi> The Emperour fearing further quarrels, durſt ſay no more, but was abſolved, and his Son was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his liberty.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Not long after this, that is, in the time of that famous King <hi>Henry,</hi> the Second, one <hi>Thomas,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107440:35"/> Becket,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was by his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary pride and inſolence the occaſion of very great diſturbance to the King and Kingdome: for the King calling his Nobles and the Clergy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deſired that ſome Clergy-men might be called to anſwer for ſome Villanies by them committed; for it was proved that ſeveral perſons had been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by their means: This <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> would not conſent unto, without a Clauſe of ſeeing this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which very much diſpleaſed the King; but by the perſwaſion of his Brethren, <hi>Becket</hi> afterward conſented; yet being incouraged by the Pope, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain fell off, and repented of what he had done, which the more inraged the King againſt him: This quarrel continued many years, and the King was ſo tormented by this proud Prelate, that he once paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately cryed out, <hi>Will no body avenge me of this Becket?</hi> Theſe words were ſpoken in the Hearing of ſome Gentlemen, who thereupon gueſſing at the Kings mind, four of them preſently went to <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and finding the Archbiſhop in the Cathedral, there, they fell upon him, and kill'd him upon the Stairs of the Altar, every one ſtriking him over the head with his Sword, and then made their eſcape. This Murder was charged upon the King by the Popes Legate, and though the King ſwore that he was neither aiding nor conſenting to his death, yet he was forced to kiſs the Legates Knee, and ſubmit to ſuch Penance as he ſhould appoint him; one part whereof was, that he ſhould abſolutely ſubmit to the Pope in all ſpiritual matters. And it is likewiſe recorded, that King <hi>Henry</hi> coming out of <hi>France,</hi> went to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and as ſoon as he was in fight of <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> Church, he got off his Horſe, and pulling off his Shoes and Stockins, he went barefoot o <hi>Beckets</hi> Tomb, the ways being ſo ſharp and ſtony
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107440:35"/> that his feet bled as he paſſed along; and when he came there, every Monk in the Cloiſter whipt the Kings Back with a Rod; which ſhews (ſaith the Hiſtorian) what ſlavery Kings and Princes were at that time brought into, by the Popes Clergy. The ſame year the City of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was almoſt burnt down, and <hi>Beckets</hi> Church was utterly conſumed. This <hi>Becket</hi> was afterward Canonized for a Saint; but a Popiſh Hiſtorian ſaith of him, <hi>That he was worthy death and damnation, for being ſo obſtinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods Miniſter, his King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. King <hi>John,</hi> the Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, was likewiſe made ſenſible of the danger of offending the Pope; for in the year 1205. the King being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt the Clergy who poſſeſſed great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and yet neglected their Charge, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to rectifie this and ſome other great miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages about Electing Biſhops, and ſeveral other things: But the Pope fearing he would intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his privileges and gain, ſtirred Heaven and Earth againſt him, Excommunicating and curſing him, giving his Kingdome to the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſtirring up his own Nobility and people againſt him; ſo that the King being compaſſed about with Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on every ſide, was forced to ſubmit to the Pope, promiſing to do whatever he ſhould command him: Nay, the King took his Crown off his head, and kneeling upon his knees, in the midſt of all his Lords and Barons he gave it to <hi>Pandulphus</hi> the Popes Legate, ſaying, <hi>Here I reſign up the Crown of the Realm of</hi> England <hi>to the hands of</hi> Pope Innocent <hi>the Third, and lay my ſelf wholly at his mercy and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Pandulphus</hi> took the Crown from King <hi>John,</hi> and kept it five days; and the King giving then all his Kingdomes to the Pope, to be held in Farm from him and his Heirs for evermore, his Crown was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107440:36"/> again, King <hi>John</hi> engaging to pay ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Marks a year for <hi>England,</hi> and three hundred for <hi>Ireland;</hi> half of it at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and half at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas,</hi> as Rent for the ſaid Kingdomes. This King <hi>John</hi> was afterward poyſoned by a Monk, which was judged ſuch a Meritorious Act, that the Murderer had a Maſs appointed to be ſaid for his Soul for ever after, by his Fellow-Monks.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> the Third, ſtanding upon the Stairs of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> he there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Oath of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and then had him into the Church, and anointed him, and ſitting in his Pontifical Chair, held the Crown of Gold between his feet, and the Emperour bowing down his head to the Popes feet, received the Crown; the Empreſs likewiſe was Crowned in the ſame manner: The Crown being thus put on, the Pope immediately kickt it off the Emperour's Head with his foot to the ground, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring thereby, that if he pleaſed he could depoſe him again: Then the Cardinals took up the Crown, and again put it on his Head.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Nay, to ſuch a height did the Popes at laſt arrive, that they governed all things; Emperours and Princes have been forced to kneel and kiſs their Toes; nay, they aſſerted, that all Kings were Slaves, and in ſubjection to them; and that all muſt be judged by the Pope; but he by no man.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHen by the juſt Judgment of the Almighty, <hi>All the World wondred after the Beaſt;</hi> and the Kings and Princes of Chriſtendom, eſtabliſhed the Authority of the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> appointing to ſlaughter and deſtruction ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the horrid Blaſphemies and Errors maintained by them; It occaſioned many good Chriſtians to deteſt their Superſtitions, as unknown to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church:</hi> And the firſt we read of, was one <hi>Berengarius,</hi> who boldly and faithfully publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the True Religion contained in the Scripture, and diſcovered the falſeneſs of the <hi>Romiſh;</hi> He lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror his coming into <hi>England,</hi> about which time his Followers being taken notice of, as diſſenting from many of the Common received Opinions of thoſe times, they were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107440:38"/> branded with the odious Name of <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Twenty years after this one <hi>Peter Bruis</hi> was a famous Preacher among them, who taught them publickly a long time at <hi>Tholouſe</hi> in <hi>Savoy;</hi> In a ſhort time after they were grown to ſo great a multitude, that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were reſolved, if poſſible, by any means to extirpate and deſtroy them, To which end, they at firſt incited ſeveral of the moſt learned of their Party to write againſt them, and warned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Princes to have a care of them, and to baniſh them out of their Territories.</p>
            <p>The firſt then that flung away the Spiritual Keys, and began valiantly to brandiſh the bloody Sword of Perſecution againſt them, was Pope <hi>Alexander the third,</hi> who began therewith to hack, hew, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the poor <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> ſo named from <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> or <hi>Waldo</hi> of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who appeared very coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in oppoſing the many Corruptions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; as Holy Oyl, Conſecrated Images, Popes Indulgences, Candles, Merits, Auricular Confeſſion, the Supremacy of the Pope, falſe Miracles, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Praying for the Dead, Prayers to Saints, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Unction, and many other Fopperies of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Communion: This Perſecution of <hi>Waldo</hi> and his Followers (who were encreaſed to a very great number) began in <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1060. <hi>Waldo</hi> being compell'd to fly into the Mountains of <hi>France,</hi> among the Savage Inhabitants, to whom he taught his Doctrine, others fled into <hi>Picardy,</hi> from whence they were called <hi>Picards,</hi> ſeveral into <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and thereby (for the ſafety of their Lives) they ſpread their Doctrine into all places.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being incited by the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks,</hi> raiſed Arms againſt them, and deſtroyed Three Hundred Gentlemens Houſes, and likewiſe ſeveral Walled Towns: And thoſe that fled into
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107440:38"/> 
               <hi>Flanders</hi> eſcaped little better, for they were perſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many of them for their Religion put to Death; And the Biſhops of <hi>Mayence</hi> and <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> raiſed great perſecutions againſt thoſe which fled thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there being Five and Thirty Citizens of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> burned in one Fire, and Eighteen in another, who ſuffered Death with very great conſtancy: and at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> at the inſtance of the Biſhop, Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore were likewiſe burnt for profeſſing the ſame Truth, and yet by the exhortations conſtancy, and patience of theſe Martyrs, there were ſuch multitudes who entertained their Doctrines, that in a few Years after in the County of <hi>Paſſau</hi> and in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> there were above Fourſcore thouſand perſons that made profeſſion of the ſame Faith. Some of them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fled into <hi>England</hi> for ſhelter, but were more barbarouſly and cruelly put to death at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by the Papiſts there, than ever any Chriſtians were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, for matters of Religion: and Three years after Pope <hi>Alexander the Third,</hi> made a Decree in the Council of <hi>Tours</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that theſe Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and all their Favourers ſhould be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and that none of them ſhould buy or ſell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it was foretold in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.17.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Colen</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> Four Men, and Two young Women were diſcovered hid in a Barn, and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> not being able to diſwade them from the Truth, The Men were all tyed to the Stake to be burnt, but the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretending to pity the young Women, perſwaded them to recant, but they perceiving their deſign, got out of the hands of thoſe that held them, and voluntarily leapt into the Fire, where they were burned with them: about this time a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was publiſhed in <hi>Aragon,</hi> whereby it was made Treaſon to relieve theſe poor Chriſtians, or to ſuffer them to live in that Country, and liberty was given
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107440:39"/> to all people to abuſe them at pleaſure, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed for the ſame. But theſe people ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, the Pope was reſolved to ſuppreſs them by all means poſſible, and therefore about the Year, 1201. He ſet up the <hi>Bloody Inquiſition,</hi> which with its Racks Tortures, Fire, and all manner of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hath deſtroyed an innumerable company of Good and Holy Men. And in the ſame Year a noble Knight called <hi>Eunandus,</hi> and one of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> was burnt at <hi>Paris:</hi> and the perſecution ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, the people of <hi>Daulphine</hi> flying from their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Enemies, ſheltred themſelves in the Caves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mountains, but their cruel Adverſaries having notice thereof, perſued and deſtroyed many of them, and the reſt fled higher into the Mountains (which were all covered with Snow) together with their Wives and Children, the Mothers carrying ſome in their Arms, and others in Cradles, and the Night coming on, and having no means to make a Fire for their tender Infants, they were ſo benummed with cold that in the morning above Fourſcore of them were found dead in their Cradles, and moſt of their Mothers died likewiſe: Many alſo were burnt in the ſame Country of <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and the Fire of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raged through the whole Land, ſo that there was ſcarce a Town or City in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but many were put to death therein, and at <hi>Turin</hi> one of them had his Bowels taken out of his Belly, and put into a Baſon, and was afterward cruelly Martyred, One <hi>Gerard</hi> being at the Stake to be burnt, requeſted the Hangman to give him Two or Three Stones, which he at firſt refuſed, thinking he would have thrown them at ſome body, but afterwards did, and <hi>Gerard</hi> taking them into his hands ſaid. <hi>When I ſhall have eaten up theſe Stones, then ſhall you ſee an end of our Religion, for which you now put me to death,</hi> and then throwing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107440:39"/> them on the Ground, he chearfully died. Theſe Countries being ſo hot with the Fire of Perſecution, many of theſe poor People fled into <hi>Calabria</hi> where they began to plant and build Towns, as <hi>Saint Xiſt La Gard,</hi> and divers others, where they continued till the year, 1560. at which time they were moſt grievouſly perſecuted by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, and were forced to leave their Houſes and Habitations, and to fly into the Woods for the ſaving of their Lives but being there purſued by order from the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> moſt of them were cruelly and barbarouſly murdered by the Souldiers, and ſome flying into fortified places, were ſo ſtraitly beſieged, that they died with Famine: And at the ſame time one <hi>Charlin</hi> was rackt in ſo horrible a manner, that his Guts came out of his Belly: Another was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon the Rack Eight hours together, to force him to confeſs what they pleaſed againſt himſelf and others, which yet he refuſed to do: Some were ſtript ſtark naked, and whipt to death with Rods of Iron, others were drawn through the Streets, and burnt with Firebrands, ſome thrown down from an High Tower, and ſome cut to pieces with ſharp Knives. By order of the Inquiſitor <hi>Panza,</hi> Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore perſons had their Throats cut, as Butchers do Sheep, and then cauſing them to be divided into Four Quarters, he made their Limbs to be ſet upon Stakes for the ſpace of Thirty Miles as a bloody ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle: A young Man was thrown from an High Tower, becauſe he would not confeſs himſelf to a Prieſt, and the Vice Roy paſſing by at the ſame time, and hearing him implore Gods Mercy not being quite dead. he kick'd him on the Head and ſaid <hi>Is the Dog yet living, Take him and caſt him to the Hogs.</hi> Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Women were ſo cruelly rackt, that the Cords pierced their Arms and Legs to the Bones, and then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107440:40"/> being caſt into Priſon all there dyed, except Nine of the handſomeſt, who being delivered to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> were never heard of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Many more were delivered to the <hi>Secular Power</hi> to be burnt, and if any interceded for them, they were preſently put on the Rack as Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> One of their Miniſters was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed in Priſon, another was carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> and burnt, the Pope and Cardinals being preſent at that pleaſing ſpectacle, but the Miniſter ſpake ſo many things out of Gods word againſt them, that the Pope gnaſhed his Teeth for Anger, and afterward promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Marqueſs of <hi>Butiana</hi> to make his Son a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, if he would clear <hi>Calabria</hi> of theſe <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> which was then no hard matter for the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and the Vice Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> did by all manner of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deſtroy Man, Woman, and Child, ſo that in a ſhort time, they were utterly rooted out of that Country.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> who fled out of <hi>Piedmont</hi> into <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> increaſing daily, and their Habitations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to <hi>Avignion</hi> (many times the Popes Seat) he ſoon raiſed an horrid Perſecution againſt them, but the greateſt was in the Year, 1360. In the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, wherein many ſuffered, which continued for ſome time more and leſs furious to the Year, 1540. About which time the Inhabitants of <hi>Merindol, Cabriers, Poſin,</hi> and other places in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> were by means of the Popes Agents cruelly Burned, Maſſacred, and Deſtroyed, The Towns were fired and laid waſt, and the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout made deſolate; The poor People were ſlain, the young Virgins raviſhed, and barbarouſly abuſed, Children were pull'd alive out of their Mothers Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the Breaſts of many cut off, ſo that the Infants died of Famine: There were only Threeſcore and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107440:40"/> ſix weak men left in the Town of <hi>Cabriers,</hi> who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to deliver it up, ſo that they might go to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> but the Enemy entring, cauſed them all to be brought into a Field and cut to pieces, the Souldiers ſtriving who ſhould ſhew the beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in cutting off Legs, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Women they put into a Barn with their young children, and ſome great with Child, and then firing a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Straw, they were barbarouſly burnt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſome endeavouring to eſcape through the flames, were knockt on the head by the bloody Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; many fled into Caves and Cellars, who being brought forth ſtark naked into the Fields, were there ſlain: others being bound back to back were in ſport run through with one Sword. As ſoon as any were found, the Villains cryed, <hi>Kill, kill,</hi> deſtroying all they met with; ſo that above a thouſand men, women and children were ſlain in this place: ſome deſired leave to depart to ſome other place, but one <hi>Opede,</hi> a chiefe Commander amofig the Papiſts ſaid, <hi>That he would ſend them to dwell in Hell, among the Devils.</hi> At <hi>Coſta,</hi> another Town, they committed great ſlaughter, and many of the Inhabitants flying into an Orchard, the Souldiers raviſhed divers of the Women and Virgins, and abuſed them in ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a manner for a day and a night, that the women with-child, and younger Maidens, died immediately after Many more were the outrages committed by the Souldiers in this Country, but the Tremendous Juſtice of God did not ſuffer ſome of the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſecutors to go unpuniſhed: For <hi>Opede,</hi> the Commander of theſe Villains, was ſtruck with a ſtrange kind of bleeding in the lower parts, that he was not able to make any Urin; ſo that his Guts rotted within him, and Worms bred in his bowels, which continually gnawed him; and ſo he lay raging
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107440:41"/> and blaſpheming, ſaying, that he felt a fire within him, which burnt him from the Navel upwards: which was accompanied with a moſt filthy ſtink from his lower parts: and in this miſerable manner he ended his wretched life. There was likewiſe one <hi>John de Roma,</hi> a Monk, who uſed horribly to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment theſe poor Proteſtants: and among the reſt, he would fill Boots with boiling Oyl, and put them upon their Legs over a ſoft fire. Thus he tormented many: but at laſt, <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his Helliſh cruelty, ſent to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Provence</hi> to apprehend him, who condemn him: but he having notice of it, fled to <hi>Arragon,</hi> where a while after he was robbed of all he had by his own ſervants, and then fell into an horrible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, unknown to the Phyſitians, being intollerably tormented with pains all over his body, ſo that he had not one minutes reſt, and no creature was able to endure him, for the intollerable ſtink which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from him, nor he himſelf, for his body was full of naſty ſores and ulcers, which ſwarmed with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and rotted away from the bones by piece-meal. In the midſt of his torments, he would in a great rage cry out. <hi>Oh! who will deliver me? who will rid me out of theſe intollerable pains which I now ſuffer, for oppreſſing and tormenting thoſe poor men?</hi> endeavouring ſeveral times to kill himſelf, but had not power: and in this horrible anguiſh and deſpair he fearfully died, no man being able to bury him, for ſome time, by reaſon of the loathſome ſmell proceeding from him, till at laſt a poor man with an Iron Hook dragg'd his Carkaſs into a Hole he had digg'd for him.</p>
            <p>During this Perſecution, the Biſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> with ſome other Biſhops, walking with ſome of their Wenches through the Streets of <hi>Avignion,</hi> they ſaw a man ſelling bawdy Pictures, Images, and Songs,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107440:41"/> which they preſently bought up: but going a little further, they found a man ſelling of <hi>French</hi> Bibles, at which being extremely enraged, they askt him how he durſt be ſo bold to ſell ſuch Merchandize in that Town; the Bookſeller anſwered, <hi>Is not the Holy Bible as good as theſe goodly Pictures you have bought for the Gentlewomen?</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Aix</hi> ſaid, <hi>I renounce my part in Paradiſe, if this Fellow be not a</hi> Lutheran: The Attendants cryed out, <hi>a</hi> Lutheran, <hi>a</hi> Lutheran, <hi>to the fire with him, to the fire with him:</hi> one giving him a blow with his Fiſt, others pulled him by the Hair and Beard ſo that the poor man was all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued in blood before he came to Priſon. The next day he was brought before the Judge, where by the inſtigation of the Biſhops he was burned the ſame day with two Bibles tyed about his Neck, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and another behind, where he made a moſt Chriſtian end.</p>
            <p>This long and bloody Perſecution of theſe <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> laſted near five hundred years in which time the Goſpel ſpread into <hi>Bohemia, Auſtria, Germany, Flanders, England, Poland, Italy, Spain, Dalmatia, Croatia, Solavonia, Salmatia, Bulgaria,</hi> and in other places to which they were driven, where they were tormented and perſecuted according to the power and influence that the Pope and his Agents had over the Princes and Governours of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Albingenſes</hi> were the ſame with the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> profeſſing the ſame Doctrines and Principles, and differing only in name, their Country being called <hi>Albi,</hi> the chief Preacher among them being one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold,</hi> from whom they were ſometimes called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldists.</hi> Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third began with them, condemning them for Hereticks; and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third raiſing a War againſt them, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107440:42"/> it the <hi>Holy War,</hi> giving the ſame <hi>Pardons</hi> and Indulgences, and promiſing Paradiſe to all that would fight againſt the Hereticks, with the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, as thoſe which went to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Sarazens.</hi> In this War he ſo thundered out Excommunications, and uſed Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Arms againſt <hi>Reymond.</hi> Earl or Prince of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> that he was forced to ſubmit; and his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were much aſtoniſhed to ſee their Lord, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diveſted of his Poſſeſſions, but led to the Church to be reconciled to it, where the Popes Legate commanded the Earl to ſtrip himſelf ſtark naked, all but his Linnen Drawers; they then put a Rope about his Neck, and led him nine times round the Grave of one <hi>Peter</hi> an <hi>Hermit,</hi> who was kill'd in that War, ſcourging him with Rods all the while; of which the Earl complaining, the Legate told him, <hi>That he must ſubmit, if he would be reconciled to the Pope; yea, he muſt be thus ſcourged before his Earls, Barons, Marqueſſes, Prelates, and all the people.</hi> He made him likewiſe ſwear to be obedient to the Pope, and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> all his life, and to make irreconcileable War againſt the <hi>Albingenſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Legate then acts the part of a General, and beſieges <hi>Bezier,</hi> and the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> deſiring to come to Terms, the Legate would admit of nothing but the renouncing of their Religion, and imbracing Popery; which they abſolutely refuſed, upon thoſe Conditions, ſaying <hi>That God was able to defend them; but if he would pleaſe to honour them to die for his ſake, they would rather diſpleaſe the Pope, than God Almighty.</hi> In a ſhort time the City was taken by Storm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſaulted by above an hundred thouſand Papiſts, the Enemy entring and ſlaying a great multitude, killing all they m t without diſtinction, the Popes Legate-bidding them <hi>kill all, both Catholicks and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107440:42"/> for the Lord knoweth who are his:</hi> So that there were threeſcore thouſand perſons ſlain in this City, the Prieſts and Fryars going about the Streets in the mean time, with Croſſes and Banners, and ſinging <hi>Te Deum Laudamus:</hi> after which, they ſet the whole City on fire, and burnt it to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>They marched next to a Town called <hi>Carcaſſon,</hi> which theſe bloody Villains (who called themſelves <hi>Holy Pilgrims</hi>) took by Storm likewiſe, killing, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deſtroying all before them, as they had done before at <hi>Beziers.</hi> They next proceeded to the City of <hi>Carcaſſon,</hi> which was about two miles from the Town, and was defended by the Earl of <hi>Pez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers:</hi> when they offered to capitulate, the Legate would grant no other Conditions, but that the Earl, and twelve more, ſhould come forth with their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, but all the reſt, both Men, Women, Maids and Children, ſhould come forth ſtark naked, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any covering, either of Shirt or Smock, and humble themſelves before him: but the Earl diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſuch unworthy Conditions, upon which the Legate aſſaulted the City; but they that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in threw down Stones, Fire, Pitch. Brimſtone, and Scalding Water from the Walls, which ſo galled the Legates Souldiers, that the Earth was covered, and the Ditch filled with their dead bodies</p>
            <p>The Legate ſinding Force would not avail, uſed Policy; and therefore, upon pretence of Parley, he perſwaded the Earl to come out of the City, with great Oaths and Execrations for his ſafe return; but having him in poſſeſſion, they kept him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and then inſtantly ſtormed the City, to the amazement of the poor Citizens, who expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs: but there being happily diſcovered a Vault in the Town which went to a Caſtle ſome miles from thence, the Citizens in the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107440:43"/> their Flight, with their Wives and Children, carrying Victuals with them only for ſome few days: the next morning they arrived at the Caſtle, and from thence diſperſed themſelves, ſome one way, ſome another, leaving the City, and all therein to the fury and rage of the <hi>unholy Pilgrims.</hi> They then ſurprized the Caſtle of <hi>Bezon,</hi> where they pulled out the Eyes, and cut off the Noſes of an hundred <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes,</hi> leaving only one with one Eye to guide the reſt to <hi>Calaret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They took likewiſe the Caſtle of <hi>Menerly,</hi> defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord of <hi>Termes,</hi> whom they flung into a filthy Priſon till he died; his Wife, Siſter, and Daughter, who was a Virgin, and likewiſe divers Noble Women, after they had in vain by frowns and threats endeavoured to draw them to Popery, were burnt in an huge fire all together: And after that, they burnt an hundred and fourſcore more in another great fire, who embraced the flames with joy, giving God thanks that he was pleaſed ſo to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, as to die for his Name. <hi>Simon Monford</hi> ſucceeded the Legate in his Generalſhip, and at the taking of the Caſtle of <hi>Lavaur,</hi> all the Souldiers were put to the Sword, except fourſcore Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom that cruel Earl cauſed to be hanged, and the Lord <hi>Almery</hi> on a Gibbet above all the reſt: the Lady his Siſter was caſt into a Ditch, and covered with Stones: the reſt of the people, who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four hundred perſons were forced into a great fire made purpoſely for them, and ſo all burnt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe that would forſake their Religion, which were very few.</p>
            <p>About this time there was one <hi>Reynard Lollard,</hi> a godly and learned man, who by his preaching ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Guiene</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> which they did accordingly, but this worthy man
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107440:43"/> was afterward burnt in <hi>Germany:</hi> They ſay he he foretold many things by Divine Revelation, which came to paſs in a ſhort time. In the year 1213. near <hi>Muret,</hi> upon the <hi>Gavon,</hi> there was a Battel between <hi>Simon Montford,</hi> and the King of <hi>Arra on,</hi> who aſſiſted the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> in which Fight the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> was ſlain and the Enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, above two Millions of <hi>Albingenſes</hi> with him, which the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> attributed to the too great confidence of the King, who depended much upon his numbers, and was feaſting while his Enemies were in Council.</p>
            <p>Fryar <hi>Conradus</hi> of <hi>Marpurg,</hi> the Popes Inquiſitor, made terrible havock of all that profeſſed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, under the names of Hereticks, whom he try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by making them paſs over red hot Irons laid at an unequal diſtance blindfold, and thoſe that were burnt were accounted Hereticks, few eſcaping the hot Irons; ſo that neither Noble, nor Ignoble, Clerks, Monks, Nuns, Burgeſſes. Citizens, nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people, eſcaped the Flames, by means of this bloody Inquiſitor. Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> took the Town of <hi>Miramond,</hi> and therein deſtroyed five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, women and children of the <hi>Albingenſes:</hi> And in the year 1234 many of them being fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> the Pope cauſed a <hi>Cruſado</hi> to be preached up againſt them whereby a great Army of <hi>Pilgrims</hi> aſſembled together and were ſent againſt them by Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> who ſlew the poor Proteſtants, with their Biſhops and Miniſters burnt their houſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed their Towns, and plundered and car ied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Goods: And about the ſame time, ſome who had retired into <hi>Germany. Millain</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> were likewiſe burnt and deſtroyed: A while after, four hundred and twenty of theſe <hi>Albingenſes</hi> were burnt at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:107440:44"/>
            <p>A great Perſecution was raiſed againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>Albi</hi> in the year 1281. ſo that they were almoſt all extirpated, and rooted out, and forced to fly to all parts for ſafety of their lives; and at the ſame time, by the Popes Order, the Bones of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral famous Miniſters among them were digged up and burnt, twenty or thirty years after they were buried. In the year 1315. the Fryars Inquiſitors raiſed an hot Perſecution againſt theſe Goſpellers in <hi>Paſhaw,</hi> and burnt many of them, who died chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and conſtantly in the Faith; and one of them who was burnt at <hi>Vienna</hi> confeſſed, that there were fourſcore thouſand of them in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> at that time. In the year 1332. <hi>Lollard Walterus,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preacher (from whom his Followers were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lollards</hi>) was taken and burnt at <hi>Collen:</hi> But notwithſtanding all theſe horrid Cruelties uſed by the Papiſts againſt theſe Saints and Servants of God, yet they could never prevail to a total extirpation of them, but they ſtill encreaſed and revived, and their Poſterity profeſs the ſame Faith to this very day.</p>
            <p>In the year 1620, in a Country called the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> or the <hi>Griſons</hi> Country, the Papiſts committed very great cruelties: thoſe poor people had for a long time enjoyed the freedom of their Religion; but about the time afore-mentioned, when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of a Town, called <hi>Tell,</hi> was preaching to his Congregation, the bloody Papiſts roſe in Arms and ſet upon them, beating and killing ſeveral of them: and among the reſt, there was an Honourable Lady who was exhorted to change her Religion, if not for her own ſake, yet out of pity to her young Infant that ſhe held in her Arms, which otherwiſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her ſelf, ſhould be immediately ſlain: But the Lady with an undaunted courage anſwered, <hi>I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107440:44"/> have not departed out of</hi> Italy, <hi>my Native Country, nor forſaken all the Eſtate that I had there, to renounce the Faith of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt; No, I will ſuffer a thouſand deaths, if it be poſſible, rather than do it: And why in this caſe ſhould I have ſo much regard to my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, ſince God my Heavenly Father ſpared not his own Son, my Lord Jeſus, but delivered him up to death in love to me, and ſuch ſinners as I am.</hi> And then giving her Child to one that ſtood by, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Behold, my Child, the Lord God, who hath care of the Birds of the Air, is much more able to ſave this poor creature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſhould by you be leſt in theſe wild Mountains.</hi> Then unlacing her Gown, ſhe opened her Breaſt, ſaying, <hi>Here is the Body which you have power to kill; but my Soul, on which you have no power to lay your hands, that I commend to my God.</hi> And then theſe Blood-hounds preſently ſlew her, and cut her to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: The Infant being a lovely ſweet Child they ſpared, and delivered to a Popiſh Nurſe to be brought up. Theſe Villains carried divers Women and Children to the tops of high Mountains, and if they would not promiſe to go to Maſs, they were thrown down headlong, and torn to pieces.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Dominico Berto,</hi> a young man of ſixteen years of age, becauſe he would not turn Papiſt, was ſet upon an Aſs, with his face to the Tail, and the Tail in his hand for a Bridle, and with many ſcoffs and mocks was brought into the Market place: there they cut off his Noſe, Ears and Cheeks, and then burnt many holes in divers parts of his body with hot Irons; and thus they barbarouſly continued to torment him till he died.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe ſeized upon a Noble young Virgin, and carried her through the Streets with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable diſgrace: They put a Miter of Paper upon her head, beſmeared her face with dirt, and buſſeted
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107440:45"/> her on the Cheeks with their Fiſts, and then bid her to call upon the Saints; but ſhe ſmiling ſaid, <hi>My truſt and my ſalvation is only in my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and upon him only will I reſt; as for the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>though ſee be bleſſed above all women, yet ſhe is not Omniſcient, and therefore knows net our requeſts; yea, ſhe her ſelf hath need of the Merits of her own Son, without which ſhe could not have been ſaved.</hi> But they reviling and abuſing her, ſhe couragiouſly ſaid, <hi>I willingly endure all this, as it becomes me to do, deſiring no better uſage, ſince the ſame was done to my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and to his Apoſtles, and to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the holy</hi> Martyrs. Upon this they carried her away, and murder'd her in the Fields.</p>
            <p>In one houſe they ſlew a man and his Wiſe; and there being a little Girl in the Cradle of about three years old, of a very amiable countenance, the poor Child ſeemed to ſmile upon them, whereupon one of theſe bloody Villains took her by the Heels and daſhed out her Brains. From thence theſe Wretches went to a Town called <hi>Bruſe,</hi> where they murthered many, by ſhooting ſome, drowning others, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, and grinding their very bones to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Amongſt others, they found an ancient Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of fourſcore years old, whom they earneſtly perſwaded to hear Maſs, and that ſhe would reſpect her age to whom with a worthy reſolution ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>God forbid that I who now of a long time have had one foot in the Grave ſhould forſake my Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who hath ſo long preſerved me in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and profeſſion of his truth, and that I ſhould now put my truſt in Creatures and ſhould receive the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, inſtead of the holy Word of God.</hi> Upon theſe words they immediately ſlew her.</p>
            <p>The ſufferings of the poor Proteſtants in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> continued ſtill; they are under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107440:45"/> of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and are the Off-ſpring of the old <hi>Waldenſes</hi> which inhabited there, and have ever ſince profeſſed the ſame Religion; they have Evangelical Churches in the ſeveral Valleys of <hi>Angrognea, Bobio, Villaro, Valguicharda, Roras, Taglia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetto,</hi> and divers others; in all which, moſt of their Inhabitants are Proteſtants, and had been long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in their Religion by the Princes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to whom they were Subjects: but in the year 1565. a cruel Edict was publiſhed, that all ſuch as would not comply with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and go to Maſs, ſhould within ten days be baniſhed from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Habitation; but by the Interceſſion of the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Elector Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> this Edict was recalled, and they continued quiet till the year 1655. wherein that late horrible Maſſacre was committed upon them for the ſake of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts had all along by many cunning Plots and contrivances endeavoured their ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by uſing all Arts to ſtir them up to Rebellion, and by planting Jeſuits Colledges among them, which like Goads in their ſides ſtill annoyed them, and prov'd a great trouble and affliction to them; for they often procured ſome cruel and harſh Edict, or Proclamation, by their Complaints and Lyes which they raiſed in the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: As in the year 1602. they got an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict for baniſhing all private and publick Proteſtant Schoolmaſters, as Enemies to the Government, and diſturbers of the Peace: and likewiſe another Edict 1622. that no Strangers, ether Miniſters or others, ſhould be entertained among them. In 1634. an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict came out, that all the Proteſtants of <hi>Compiglione</hi> ſhould be baniſhed; and in 1654. the ſame was done againſt thoſe of <hi>Martino,</hi> and <hi>Peroſa.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107440:46"/> Miſſionary Fathers behaved themſelves among them more cruelly than <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But at laſt reſolving utterly to root out the Proteſtants from among them, and throughly to perform the will of their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy Father</hi> the Pope, they procured an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the midſt of Winter, that is <hi>January</hi> 25. 1655. (which is very ſharp in thoſe Countries) for the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of all Proteſtants out of the Valleys of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerna, Lucernetta,</hi> and ſeven other places, within three days after publication, unleſs they would turn <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks; and this extended to all in general, none being excepted, of what Rank, Degree, or Condition ſoever they were. And thus theſe poor Creatures were forced in compliance with this cruel Edict, to fly for the ſecurity of their Lives and Conſciences in the depth of the Snow, and when all the Valleys were covered with water, there being among them ſome Women with-child, others newly delivered, young children crying and lamenting, old women, and decrepit men, leaning on their Staves, all dragged over the Ice, through Rain, Snow, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and a thouſand inconveniencies and hardſhips; ſo that it would have grieved the heart of a <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> to have ſeen them leaving their Goods behind them, or ſelling them for little to the Papiſts, who took no pity of their bitter tears, ſighing, ringing of hands, beating of Breaſts, mourning, complaining, and lamenting: but all theſe calamities were but as the bleating of Sheep, or the lowing of Oxen to Popiſh ears, and they rather rejoyced than commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerated the condition of theſe poor Wretches: They were no ſooner gone, but their houſes were pillaged, rifled, and ranſackt of all that was left, and then pull'd to the ground; yea, the Trees were cut down, and ſuch havock and devaſtation made, as all was turned into a Wilderneſs.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:107440:46"/>
            <p>This cruel Edict was put in execution by one <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaldo,</hi> and others; but this was not all, the Deſign was for the utter extirpating and roofing out Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as they called theſe Religious Souls: it would not ſatisfie them to have baniſhed theſe few, and the poor Proteſtants could have no redreſs at Court, for all their humble Petitions and Remonſtrances could not be heard. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> had yet more wicked and bloody Deſigns againſt them; and to that purpoſe, they imployed ſome <hi>Romiſh</hi> Agents who had great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over the Duke and Dutcheſs of Savoy.</p>
            <p>It is next to impoſſible to reckon up the variety of Cruelties and Murders committed upon theſe poor Innocent Souls; we ſhall therefore only give a brief Abſtract of ſome remarkable paſſages that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened therein</p>
            <p>Upon the ſeventeenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1655. whilſt the Proteſtant Deputies were detained at <hi>Turin,</hi> and delayed with hopes of redreſs, ſome Souldiers were ſent on purpoſe to fall unexpectedly upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who peaceably attended the iſſue of their Petitions, which cauſed ſome buſtle; for the poor people being prompted by the Law of Nature ſtood upon their defence and the Papiſts loſt fifty men, the Proteſtants only two. Wedneſday <hi>April</hi> 22. the Marqueſs of <hi>Pianeſſa,</hi> the <hi>Popiſh</hi> General, came to the Valley of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> and promiſed them there ſhould be no violence offered to them, provided they would but quarter a few Souldiers as a token of their obedience, which the well-meaning people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to; but no ſooner were theſe Troops entred, but they put all to Fire and Sword, ſlaying all they met with that had but the likeneſs of mankind, and that in the moſt barbarous manner they could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deviſe.</p>
            <p>There joyned immediately to this Army a great
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107440:47"/> number of Outlaws, Priſoners, and other Offenders, who thought to have ſaved their Souls, and filled their Purſes by killing <hi>Hereticks:</hi> Six Regiments of <hi>French,</hi> beſides <hi>Iriſh,</hi> likewiſe helped them in this good work the Country being promiſed to the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> when cleared of Proteſtants. With theſe, and ſeveral other Troops of Highway-men and Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, by the Licenſe of their General, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts and Monks, the moſt unheard-of Villanies were committed upon the poor <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> So that there was nothing to be ſeen through the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Valleys but Churches burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Towns ſmoaking, Houſes flaming, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children maſſacred and murdered; nothing to be heard, but the confuſed cryes of people flying, the piercing groans of others dying, and the horrid ſhrieks of others that were tormented: and indeed ſo dreadful was their uſage, that it is ſcarce to be expreſſed. In one place they moſt cruelly torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an hundred and fifty Women and Children, and afterwards chopped off the Heads of ſome, and daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the Brains of others againſt the Rocks; they took multitudes of Priſoners, and ſuch of them who were fifteen years of age and upwards, if they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go to Maſs, ſome of them were hanged up, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had their feet nail'd to Trees, with their Heads hanging down, all which they conſtantly endured. A <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryar, and another Prieſt, ſet fire to all the Churches and Houſes at S. <hi>Giovanni, La Toure,</hi> and other places, ſo that they left not one ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>In theſe Deſolations the Mother was bereaved of her ſweet Child, the Husband of his dear Wife, thoſe which were richeſt among them were forced to beg their bread; yea, they lay weltring in their own blood, and the pretence for all thoſe bloody
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107440:47"/> Maſſacres and Cruelties was, that they were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to their Princes Commands, in not performing an abſolute impoſſibility, by immediately departing from their Habitations in ſo ſhort a time; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for their frequent Petitioning to the Duke to take pity upon them.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Cruelties which were executed would exceed the belief of man, but that they are ſo fully proved by the Atteſtations of Eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by the woful cryes of ſo many poor deſolate Wretches who have been miſerably robbed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled of their Relations, Friends Lands and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: yea one of the chief Commanders of their own Army that acted theſe cruelties, made a formal Oath of the reality thereof, and Signed it with his own hand before two ſufficient Witneſſes, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the voluntary confeſſion of one of the Souldiers who told ſome of his Fellows, that during the heat of the Maſſacre, he had divers times ſurfeited with eating the boiled Brains of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The barbarous cruelties following, which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon thoſe poor people, are likewiſe atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by divers Perſons of Honour and Integrity, who were for the moſt part eye or ear-witneſſes of the ſame.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Sarah Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ues,</hi> about threeſcore years of age, was commanded to ſay her prayers, and becauſe ſhe refuſed to ſay <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> they ript her up alive, by putting a Sickle into her privy parts, and ſo ſlit up her Belly; after which they dragged her about, and at laſt cut off her Head.</p>
            <p>Other Women had their Breaſts, Noſes, Privities and Hands cut off, and ſo left to periſh miſerably; another they ſtab d in the ſoles of his feet, then cut off his Privities and fry'd them, giving them their Comrades to eat as a delicate Diſh; then they ſeared
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107440:48"/> his Wounds with flaming Candles, cut off his Ears, and tore off his Nails with burning Pincers, to make him renounce his Religion; but he ſtill continuing conſtant, they tyed one of his Legs to a Mule, and ſo drag'd him about the Streets till he was almoſt dead: and after all this, they bound a Cord about his Head, and twiſted it with a Stick till his eyes and brains burſt out, and then caſt his body into a River.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Peter Simond</hi> of <hi>Angrogna</hi> they bound hand and foot, and then flung him down a dreadful Rock, or Precipice; but he happened in his fall to hang upon the ſtump of an old Tree, where he continued alive ſeveral days in a miſerable languiſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before he died, not being able to help himſelf, and the Precipice being ſo high, that no other could come at him.</p>
            <p>They cut the body of an old man of ninety years of age into ſmall pieces, and then cut off his head. Others had their bodies torn and cut in pieces, and their limbs ſtrowed in the high-ways, and hung upon Hedges. An old Woman had her Hands and Noſe cut off, and ſo was left alive. The body of another Woman was found in a Cave with all the fleſh ſliced from the bones, and chopt like minced meat. Theſe bloody Papiſts took many little Children, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Infants, and threw them down the ſleep Rocks, whereby they were daſhed to pieces.</p>
            <p>They took a Gentlemans Daughter, and put a long Stake into her body, and then carried her upon their ſhoulders, till at laſt being weary, they ſtuck the Stake into the ground and ſo left her as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Spectacle. <hi>Andrea Michalin</hi> being taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, made his eſcape ſtrangely, having firſt ſeen three of his own Children torn limb from limb, and the fourth and youngeſt had its brains beaten out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107440:48"/> the Rocks. They wofully tormented others, by fleying off their skins alive in long ſlices, of which they made Points.</p>
            <p>The Daughter of one <hi>Peter Fontana,</hi> a beautiful Girl of about ten years of age, being ſurprized by ſome of theſe lecherous Bruits, becauſe they could not raviſh her in an ordinary way, they ſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely abuſed her, that they left her for dead. The Daughter of one <hi>Moſes Long</hi> they ſpitted upon a Pike, and roaſted her alive, with a fire made upon a broad ſtone. One <hi>Jacob Michelino</hi> they took, and binding his hands to his Privities, hanged him upon a gate, and there left him in exquiſite torments in that ſhameful manner, as they like wiſe did by many others in the ſame kind. Four Brothers, and a man and his Wife, all at one time had their mouths cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med full of Gunpowder, and ſo being fired, their heads were torn to pieces.</p>
            <p>The Schoolmaſter of <hi>Roras</hi> being ſtript naked, after they had torn off his Nails with Pincers, and made a thouſand holes in his hands with their Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they dragg'd him through the Town of <hi>Lucer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and at every turn, one Souldier cut off a Collop of his fleſh from one ſide, and another from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, crying, <hi>What ſayſt thou, wilt thou go to Maſs, thou Dog?</hi> To which with admirable conſtancy he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Much rather death than the Maſs, diſpatch me quickly for the love of God.</hi> At laſt they cut off his head, and flung him into the River.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Giovanni,</hi> with his Wife and Child, were thrown down from a very high Rock, the Mother holding the Child in her arms, and three days after they were found dead, only the Child was alive, and claſped ſo faſt in the dead Mothers arms, that they could hardly get it out. They took another at the ſame place, and put out his Eyes, and then cut off
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107440:49"/> his Privities, and thruſting them in his mouth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him ſome time as a miſerable Spectacle, and he being yet alive, they flead off his skin, and hung it in the Windows of four principal houſes in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerna,</hi> after they had divided it into four pieces. They took out the brains of <hi>Daniel Cardon,</hi> and fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in a Pan, eat them up like Canibals, and then cut open his breaſt alſo, that they might eat his Heart, but were frighted by ſome <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Troops that were marching that way. They burned four Women of between eighty and ninety years old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; they cut divers to pieces, and gave their fleſh to Dogs. In another place, having taken eleven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, they heated a Furnace, and forced them to throw one another into it, till it came to the laſt man, whom they threw in themſelves.</p>
            <p>They ſtabbed ſome with impoyſoned Knives in the legs and feet, and ſo left them in torment, till they died. One <hi>Gros,</hi> a Miniſters Son, being taken by them, they cut off his fleſh in ſmall Gobbets while he was alive, and in the preſence of his Wiſe and Children, whom they murdered likewiſe before his eyes. A Woman with ſeven Children were all bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murdered in their Beds: One <hi>Daniel Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,</hi> becauſe he refuſed to ſay <hi>Jeſu Maria,</hi> or pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> they firſt cut off one finger, then another, till they had cut them all off; then they cut off his hands and arms, till after this manner they had cruelly mangled him to death: Others they ſhut up between two Stone-walls and ſtarved them to death. And to conclude, there was no manner of death no kind of cruelty or torment, that theſe Firſt-born of Hell could invent or deviſe, but they were exerciſed with the utmoſt ſeverity upon the poor miſerable Proteſtants; and it would be almoſt endleſs, to give a particular account of all that we murdered,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107440:49"/> drowned, burnt, ſhot, ſtarved, ſmothered, knockt on the head, and cut in pieces by theſe barbarous Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Theſe horrid and inhumane practices made the reſt of the Proteſtants fly to their Arms in the natural defence of themſelves, and their Families, againſt the rage and fury of Lyons, Tygers, and Bears, in the ſhapes of men: But thoſe that were ſo brisk at maſſacring and murdering ſuch as did not reſiſt them, were meer Cowards at fighting, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants prevail'd againſt them with ſmall numbers, and defended themſelves againſt their Cruelty.</p>
            <p>But at laſt by the Mediation of the <hi>Switzers, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and other Proteſtant Princes, and eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who contributed above thirty thouſand pound to the relief of their wants and miſeries, the breach was made up; but yet ſo made, that the poor remaining <hi>Proteſtants</hi> live under the Tyranny of their <hi>Popiſh</hi> Task-maſters, being forbid all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Traffick, wronged of their Eſtates and Goods, their Miniſters baniſhed, their Virgins raviſhed, the women affronted, the men beaten and abuſed, and the Valleys are become like Dungeons, in which they are kept as Slaves, and ſecured by ſtrong Forts and Garriſons of Papiſts; ſo that they are even dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whilſt they live, and have cauſe to cry out, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge our blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.10.</p>

               </gap>7 years after the death of our bleſſed Saviour: Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Hell-brand</hi>) was the firſt that fell upon them, and afterwards Pope <hi>Celeſtine;</hi> and Perſecution continued upon them for many years, and <hi>John Huſs,</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> were burnt in defence of the Goſpel at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they had the Publick Faith of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Germany</hi> given them for their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>At a Town called <hi>Cuttenburgh</hi> there are many deep Metal Mines, into one of which, in the year 1420. the Papiſts threw one thouſand and ſeven hundred perſons at one time, for their Religion; into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one thouſand thirty eight; and into a third, a thouſand three hundred and thirty four perſons.</p>
            <p>In the year 1421. one <hi>Pichel,</hi> a chief Magiſtrate of the City <hi>Litomeritia,</hi> having taken twenty four of the chief Citizens, and among them his Son-in-law; put them in an high Tower, and being there almoſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, they were at laſt brought out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be drowned, their Wives, Children and Friends following them to execution with cryes and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107440:51"/> tears; yea, the Magiſtrates own Daughter came with prayers and tears to her Father, beſeeching him to ſpare her Husband; but he like a hard-hearted wretch only ſaid, <hi>Cannot you have a better Husband than this?</hi> To whom, ſeeing his cruelty, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>You ſhall never marry me to any but this:</hi> And ſo going along with them, when ſhe ſaw her Husband thrown into the River, ſhe leapt in after him, and imbracing him, endeavoured to ſave his life; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to do it, they both periſhed together, and the next day ſhe was found with him faſt in her Arms, and they were both buried in one Grave.</p>
            <p>A while after a Miniſter, four men, and four Boys, were all burnt together in one fire at <hi>Prague,</hi> becauſe they received the Sacrament in both kinds: and indeed many and almoſt innumerable were the murthers, torments, and inhumane barbarities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted both publickly and privately on theſe poor Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>About the year 1523. <hi>Martin Luther</hi> began to ſhine as a great light in <hi>Germany,</hi> and his Doctrine ſoon overſpread <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and all the parts adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which ſo enraged the Pope and his Clergy that they continually raiſed very violent perſecutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, wherein multitudes of good Chriſtians loſt their lives by means of <hi>Ferdinand the Firſt,</hi> and <hi>Charles the Fift,</hi> Emperours of <hi>Germany.</hi> There were no leſs than two hundred Miniſters baniſhed out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> at one time, and the Lord of <hi>Schanow,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> was accuſed of a Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and laid upon the Rack; but he couragiouſly cut out his own Tongue, and being demanded the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, he wrote, <hi>That it was leſt the torments of the Rack ſhould make him ſpeak falſly againſt himſelf, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1617. <hi>Ferdinand the Second</hi> was obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107440:51"/> upon the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> who joyning with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, raiſed up a very terrible Perſecution againſt the Proteſtants, which was the cauſe of the Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Frederick, Prince Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to be King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> upon which there followed thoſe cruel Wars and troubles in that Country, wherein many godly Miniſters, and other pious, holy, and good men, ſuffered ſuch barbarities and inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the Popiſh Souldiers, that the Ears of a Chriſtian cannot hear, nor his Tongue relate them, without the greateſt abhorrency and indignation: for ſome of them were ſtoned to death, others hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Beam, and with a ſoft fire made under them were roaſted to death, others were cut piece-meal: One Miniſter they laid on his back, and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his mouth full of Gunpowder, ſet fire to it, and blew his head all to pieces: Another they hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the Privy Members, being ſeventy years old, and burnt his own Books under him, and at laſt ſhot him to death, after he had endured all manner of torment and pain.</p>
            <p>In the year 1621. all the Miniſters were baniſhed out of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereunto belonging, never more to return; and it was made death to harbour or conceal any of them. About the ſame time twenty one Miniſters were baniſhed from <hi>Cuttenburg:</hi> A Popiſh Captain cauſed a Miniſters hand firſt to be ſtricken off, and then his head, his bowels to be taken out, and wrapt in his ſhirt, and his four quarters to be ſet upon four Stakes, and his head on another. At the ſame time likewiſe fifty of the Nobility were condemned, ſome to death, ſome to baniſhment, and others to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual impriſonment; twenty ſeven were executed, who all died with great conſtancy of mind, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of ſpirit, ſealing the Proteſtant Cauſe with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107440:52"/> their blood, the heads and right hands of ſome of them were hung upon the Tower of the Bridge, but when the Valiant <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> came into <hi>Germany,</hi> their heads and hands were by his Order taken down and ſolemnly buried.</p>
            <p>Not long after there was an Edict publiſhed in <hi>Bohemia</hi> for the baniſhing of all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that their Children ſhould be taken from them that they might be brought up in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion. Another Edict was publiſhed, that all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Women who had married <hi>Popiſh</hi> Husbands, ſhould be baniſhed and removed away from them, unleſs they would turn <hi>Papists,</hi> and likewiſe that no <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould have any Commerce with <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon this there followed a cruel Perſecution, ſo that there was ſcarce a City, Town, or Village in the whole Country, but the poor Proteſtants ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered very great torments and barbarities. In one City they ſlew the Mayor, together with ſixteen hundred men, women, and children, and ſuffered their bodies to lye unburied ſeveral days in the dirt and mire, and the remainders of the Citizens they caſt into Priſons, where they lay in a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Bibles, and all manner of Religious Books were prohibited, and likewiſe Marriages, Burial, and Baptiſm, were denied to all that would not turn <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were thruſt into Dungeons and Vaults full of Snakes, Toads, and other filthy Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; others were put into places full of Iron Spikes, ſo that they could neither ſit nor ſtand; others were laid upon narrow Beams over deep waters, that if they did but ſtir their bodies, they were in danger to be drowned. They put Gags into the mouths of ſome, and then thruſt their <hi>Hoſt</hi> or <hi>Wafer Cake</hi> down their Throats: others were beaten on the Calves of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107440:52"/> their Legs, ſo that they could not ſtand nor go, but were forced to fall down on their knees, that they might adore their <hi>Hoſt.</hi> And thus briefly of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of cruelties committed by the Papiſts on the Proteſtants in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the whole whereof would not be contained in a large Volume.</p>
            <p>The next Theater where we may behold theſe bloody Papiſts acting their Tragedies is GERMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY, which was miſerably torn and rent to pieces by their cruelties, they endeavouring by all manner of ſeverity to have extinguiſhed the light of the Goſpel, which was diſcovered by <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and others, who were ſtirred up of God to expoſe the corruptions and ſuperſtitions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church: whereupon in the year 1523. the Pope excited the Emperour <hi>Charles the Fifth</hi> to deſtroy all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> as Hereticks, and allowed him two hundred thouſand Crowns toward the raiſing of Souldiers to that purpoſe, the Pope likewiſe further engaging to raiſe twelve thouſand Foot, and ſix hundred Horſe, at his own charge, for carrying on the work: and thus he began with the Sword, that he might end with the Faggot.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the <hi>Lanſgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> ſtand up for the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and are taken Priſoners, in the year 1547. And where ever the Papiſts got the better, all ſorts of cruelties, murders, racks, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, fire and faggots followed upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſo that all <hi>Germany</hi> was as it were in a flame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion at once, all places being in a lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſome flying, and others ſuffering death on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide for their Conſcience and Religion.</p>
            <p>At a Town called <hi>Meldorp,</hi> they took a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, named <hi>Sutphen</hi> out of his Bed, and forced him to go miles on foot in Froſt and Snow upon the Ice, bare-footed and bare-legg'd, beating, cutting, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107440:53"/> flaſhing him, and pricking him forward with their Halberts, and at laſt they barbarouſly roaſted him to death. Many were drowned at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and put to ſeveral ſorts of death.</p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlewomen were yoakt together like Beaſts and ſo were turned out into the Woods, where they were raviſhed and abuſed, and then had their Hair and Ears cut off, and disfigured. In <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meren</hi> they forced the people to eat their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and if they refuſed them, they thruſt them down their Throats till they were choaked: They cram'd the ſecret parts of ſeveral women with Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and ſo ſetting fire to it, moſt barbarouſly tore their Bellies and Wombs.</p>
            <p>Divers were hung up by the privy parts; they plained the faces of others with Chiſels; others they cauſed to draw on Boots filled with ſcalding Oyl, and ſo roaſted their legs over the fire: ſome men they gelt in the preſence of their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: others had their bodies hung up by Cords, and by tying great weights to their limbs, all the joynts of their body were put out of joynt; ſome had Gags put in their mouths, and had ſtinking wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and piſs powred down their Throats through a Tunnel till their bellies ſwell'd like a Tun, whereby they died in moſt cruel torment: They ſawed off the legs of ſome alive, and one Miniſter they bound upon a Table, and placing a great Cat upon his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo provoked the Cat, that ſhe ſcratcht his guts out of his belly with her Teeth and Nails, till he miſerably died.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Magdenbur,</hi> they raviſhed the Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a famous Miniſter before his face, and then violently ſnatcht a ſucking Infant from its Mothers breaſt, and ſtuck it on the top of a Lance; and when they had tormented his Eyes and Heart with theſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107440:53"/> horrid Spectacles, they brought the Miniſter into the Street, and burnt him with his own Books.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſuch was their abominable filthineſs in <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> that they raviſhed the faireſt Virgins before their Parents faces, forcing them to ſing Pſalms the while: one beautiful young woman they raviſhed, and then cut to pieces, hanging up her quarters in the Church: Girls of ten years old, and under, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed and abuſed, till they killed them; nay, ſo monſtrous beaſtly were they, that they committed filthineſs with the dead Corps of thoſe women whom they had murdered. At <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Friburg</hi> they did the like, neither pitying old nor young, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor innocent Babes, whom ſometimes they moſt barbarouſly uſed to eat, even when other meat might be had, yea ſuch inhumane cruelty they uſed, that in many places they left none remaining alive to relate the ſufferings of thoſe that were murdered.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe Maſſacres and bloody murders defiled the whole Land, and <hi>Germany</hi> groaned under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, till the peace of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſnaburg</hi> in the year 1648. which put a ſtop to this cruel Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> being compelled thereto, by Gods bringing in the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who over-ran <hi>Germany</hi> in a ſhort time, and thereby revived the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe,</hi> which was almoſt over-run and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by ſo many thouſand violences and miſeries, as it had lain under for many years.</p>
            <p>Theſe bloody Tyrants vented their rage and fury not only in <hi>Germany,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and other Countries, for they committed the ſame Villanies in all places where they had power, the Miniſters were generally baniſhed, and put to death, and the ſame Picture of their cruelties which has been repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you in <hi>Germany,</hi> was acted over again in this Kingdom, which we have not room to inſert, only a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107440:54"/> new ſort of death was invented there; they tyed Hens Geeſe, Ducks and Hares to the naked body of a worthy Miniſter in that Country, and then ſet the Dogs upon him, who tore and rent his fleſh till he died.</p>
            <p>You have beheld many ſad and doleful Spectacles, (and Reader, if thou art a Chriſtian, thy heart muſt almoſt bleed at the relation of them) we will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Epitomize the bloody cruelties of the Papiſts in POLAND.</p>
            <p>All the ſame things, or worſe if it be poſſible, which we have related to be done in other places, were likewiſe acted in <hi>Poland;</hi> many thouſand <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> and good Chriſtians have been deſtroyed in that Kingdom, and eſpecially at <hi>Karmin, Dumbuick, Shochy, Carienzin,</hi> and <hi>Leſna,</hi> all which Cities and Towns were deſtroyed and burnt to the ground for the cauſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Leſna</hi> was one of the moſt ancient and flouriſhing Cities in all the Kingdome of <hi>Poland,</hi> which was wholly laid in aſhes, being three whole days in flames erre it was conſumed, in which there periſhed many hundred Proteſtants, beſides ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable wealth and treaſure, no man reſiſting or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the fire: Here they pulled off the Noſes of ſome, and put out the eyes of others, and cut off the tongues, hands, and feet of divers, giving quarter to none, but killing and deſtroying all that came in their way. They cut off the hands of a pious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of <hi>Leſna,</hi> and then murdered three of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before her face, cutting off their heads, and laying one at each breaſt, and the other by her ſide. Another woman having her hands and feet cut off, and her tongue cut out, they ſowed up in a Sack, and ſo left her for two days in which ſhe lived, making a moſt miſerable lamentation.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:107440:54"/>
            <p>In the Lower <hi>Poland</hi> a multitude ſuffered, whole Families were butchered, and men and women, young and old, murdered without diſtinction. And in the year 1654. there was an horrible ſlaughter amongſt them, the Papiſts putting to death all the Proteſtants they could meet with to moſt exquiſite tortures: One Mr. <hi>Samuel Cardus,</hi> a Miniſter, they uſed with extreme cruelties, firſt putting out his eyes, and leading him about as a miſerable Spectacle; then they pull'd off his fingers with Pincers, and powred melted Lead down his throat, and while he was yet half alive, they put his Neck between two folding doors, and ſo violently ſevered his head from his body.</p>
            <p>They uſed the Miniſter of <hi>Dembuick,</hi> and another Miniſter, very barbarouſly; for after they had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways tormented them, they cut their throats with a Razor, and while they were breathing, flung them into a Pit, and covered them with filth and dung.</p>
            <p>The ſame Cruelties the Barbarous and bloody Papiſts acted againſt the Proteſtants in LITHU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANIA, in the year 1648. ſlaughtering all that were not <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> without diſtinction of Age or Sex. Here many had their skins flead off while they were alive, others their hands and feet cut off, ſome their bowels taken out alive, others had their Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones bored through; they powred melted Lead into the wounds of ſome whom they had cut in the head, and other parts of their bodies: ſome had their eyes pulled out, and thoſe that were hanged up in all places were ſuch a multitude, that they are hard to be numbered, It was counted a great mercy and kindneſs to be ſhot, beheaded, or killed out-right, without any other torment.</p>
            <p>The Wives and Daughters of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107440:55"/> every where raviſhed, their Houſes and Goods burnt and deſtroyed, all their Country and their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches laid waſt, ſo that there was nothing to be ſeen in every place but Murders and Maſſacres, and the blood of the poor ſuffering <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ran like Streams through the Streets of Towns and Cities, and thoſe that were left alive, and eſcaped the ſlaughter, were baniſhed their Country for ever.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters were chiefly aimed at, and always cruelly tormented, among the reſt one <hi>Adrian Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miskie,</hi> (who was famous for his great Piety and Learning, and likewiſe for his Reverend Age) was by theſe barbarous wretches roaſted alive, and this they did leiſurely, with a few Chips and Straw, that he might be the longer in torment. In another place above forty ſuffered death by ſeveral ſorts of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Near <hi>Vilna,</hi> the chiefeſt City in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> one <hi>Smolskie,</hi> and his Son, both Miniſters, had their Heads cruelly ſawed off with a Sickle. Another Miniſter had his fleſh ſliced off by piece-meal, till he died-And to conclude this Field of Blood, there were no leſs than fifteen hundred poor Proteſtants, Miniſters as well as others, who were bound to Stakes on the tops of Mountains in the Winter, and there miſerably ſtarved to death with hunger and cold. In a word, no Age nor Hiſtory can parallel all the ſeveral tortures and miſerable deaths which theſe poor Proteſtants ſuffer'd from the hands of bloody Papiſts, for no other Crime but profeſſing and aſſerting the Truth and Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <head>The Perſecutions and Cruelties of the Papiſts upon the Proteſtants in <hi>France;</hi> with an Account of the Bloody Maſſacre at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ABout the year 1209. There were divers Learn'd men in <hi>France,</hi> the Diſciples of our <hi>Almericus</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> who being taken notice of, to hold other Opinions then thoſe commonly heard of at that time; Six of them were brought upon Examination, who freely declared, that they did believe, <hi>That God was no otherwiſe preſent in the Sacramental Bread, than in any other Bread; That it was Idolatry to build Altars to Saints, or offer incenſe to their Images: That it was rediculous to kiſs or Worſhip Relicks.</hi> They ſaid, <hi>that the Pope was</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>and</hi> Rome, <hi>was</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. Theſe being counted horrible Errors in that dark time of ſuperſtition, they were perſwaded to recant; and upon their refuſal ſo to do, were condemned and burnt at <hi>Paris;</hi> And the bones of their Maſter <hi>Almericus,</hi> which had been buried in the Church-yard, were dig'd up, and buried in the Fields.</p>
            <p>In the year 1524, One <hi>John Clark</hi> ſet up a Bill on the Church door, againſt the Popes Pardons, and called him <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> for which being apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was ordered to be whipt ſeveral days, and then burned in the fore-head; His Mother a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Woman, ſtanding by, encouraged him, ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>Bleſſed be Christ, and welcome be theſe marks for his ſake.</hi> After this he went to <hi>Mitz;</hi> and there being ſome Images without the City which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107440:57"/> the People uſed to worſhip once a year, the Evening before <hi>John Clark</hi> abhorring their Idolatry, went and brake down all their Idols; the next morning when the Clergy and People came to their Worſhip, they found their Image lye all broken on the Ground, upon which there began a great Tumult, and <hi>John Clark</hi> was ſuſpected and taken; who preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the Fact, and gave Reaſons for his ſo doing; for which he was condemned to a moſt cruel death, His Right hand was firſt cut off, then his Noſe was violently pulled off, and after that his Arms and Breaſts with ſharp Pincers all which he ſuſtained with admirable Patience, uttering all the while the words of the 115 <hi>Pſalm. Their Idols are Silver and Gold, the work of mens hands.</hi> Laſtly, he was thrown into the Fire, and burnt to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>A while after a great number of Proteſtants at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Melda, Linoſin,</hi> and divers other Cities and Towns in <hi>France</hi> were burnt, rackt, whipt; beaten, and otherways tormented to death. At <hi>Melda</hi> one was burnt for ſaying <hi>That the Maſs was a plain denial of the death and paſſion of Chriſt.</hi> He often meditated on the word of Chriſt: <hi>He that denies me before men, him will I alſo deny before my Father.</hi> He was burned in a ſlow Fire and endured much torment.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Stephen Brame,</hi> being condemned to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Conſtant Profeſſion of his Faith, when the Fire was kindled, a great wind drove away the Flame from him, ſo that he ſtood for an hours ſpace inſtructing and exhorting the People: They then brought Oyl Veſſels, and more Faggots, yet ſtill was the flame driven from him, whereupon the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtruck him on the head with a ſtaff, to whom he ſaid, <hi>I am condemned to be burned, and do you ſtrike me with Staves like a Dog;</hi> after which the Hangman run him through the Belly with a Pike, and then threw him in the Fire, and ſcattered his Aſhes in the wind.</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:107440:57"/>
            <p>Four Proteſtants were condemned at <hi>Roan</hi> and were carried to the Stake in a Dung Cart, at which they rejoyced ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be God we are reputed as the Excrements of this World, but yet our death is a ſweet ſavour unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aymond de Lavoy,</hi> a Godly Miniſter was burnt at <hi>Burdeux;</hi> and likewiſe one <hi>Vercote</hi> another Miniſter, who was impriſoned in ſuch a narrow place, that he could neither ſtand nor lye down, in which they kept him ſeven weeks, whereas before no other Malefactor could endure that Torment above fifteen days without dying, or growing mad, afterwards they cut off his Tongue, and laſtly they were ſo merciful to execute him.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Thomas</hi> a young man of Eighteen years old coming from <hi>Geneva</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> rebuked one for ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereupon he was apprehended for a <hi>Lutheran</hi> and carried before the Inquiſition, who committed him to Priſon, and rackt him ſo cruelly to confeſs his Companions, that one of the bloody Inquiſitors turned back his head and wept, yea the Hangman ſelf was weary; He was then carryed to be burned and was let down into the Fire by a Pully, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward puld up again, and asked if he would yet turn, To whom he ſaid, <hi>He was in his way to God and deſired them to let him go, and ſo he quietly ſlept in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> a great Inſtrument of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, committed many Barbarous Cruelties upon the Proteſtants, and among the reſt at a place called <hi>Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi> he murd ed ſeveral Hundreds of Men, Women and Children who were aſſembled to hear a Sermon, mangling their Limbs, and ſtrewing them about the Seats and Galleries of the Church, and at another Town called <hi>Seulis,</hi> ſome were beheaded, ſome whipt, ſome beaten, others ſent to the Gallys, the poor women being likewiſe made Slaves. Among the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107440:58"/> reſt one <hi>Fournia</hi> a Miniſter was tormented by having his Thumbs ſtrained with a ſmall cord till the blood iſſued out at the ends of them, and with another Cord was hoiſted up by the Thumbs, and then twitcht down again, having great Stones tyed to his Toes, and ſo was hanged till his Spirits failed him, and then they ſuddenly let him fall with his Face on the hard Floor, with which Barbarous Uſage he in a ſhort time dyed, being near fifty years old.</p>
            <p>In the year 1559, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond of <hi>France,</hi> there was one <hi>Ann du Bourg,</hi> a Noble-man, and of admirable wiſdom and underſtanding, who when the King came one time into his Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> made a bold Speech before him, wherein he gave hanks to Almighty God for moving the Kings Heart to be preſent at ſuch a weighty matter as that of Religion, (which it ſeems was then to be debated) humbly intreating him to conſider well thereof, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cauſe of Chriſt himſelf, which of good Right ought to be maintained by Princes, but the King was ſo far from harkning to him, that being inraged he commanded him to be committed to Priſon, and proteſted to him in theſe very words, <hi>Theſe Eyes of mine ſhall ſee thee burnt.</hi> And a while after he was condemned to dye. In the mean time great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs were preparing for the marriage of the Kings Siſter and Daughter, and the day being come, He ſpent all the morning in Examining matters againſt <hi>Du Bourg,</hi> and ſome others charged with the ſame Doctrines, intending to glut his Eyes with their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; and then went to Dinner; After Dinner the King ran at Tilt near the Priſon where <hi>Du Bourg</hi> was, and brake many Spears againſt the Count <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi> and others, and all thinking he had done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, deſired him to give over with praiſe; But the King being inflamed with their Commendations would needs run another courſe with Count <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:107440:58"/> who upon his knees beg'd his Majeſty pardon, but the King being reſolved, commanded him to do it upon his Allegiance, <hi>Montogomery,</hi> being compel'd addreſt himſelf to it, and the King and he meeting broke their Spears, and the Kings Helmet falling down at the ſame Inſtant, one of the Splinters of <hi>Montgomeries</hi> Spear entred juſt into his right eye, and ſo pierced his head, that his brains were periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which wound being incurable, he dyed thereof, within Eleven days after; whereby his great hopes of ſeeing the Death of <hi>Du Bourg</hi> were fruſtrated; And the Execution of <hi>Du Bourg</hi> was deferr'd for ſix Months longer, all which time perſevering conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the truth, he was firſt degraded, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſix or ſeven hundred Horſe and Foot well armed, he was guarded to Execution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt hang'd, and then burnt to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Amiens</hi> in <hi>France</hi> all the Bibles, Teſtaments and Pſalm Books were burnt, the Miniſters Pulpit, and ſeveral Men and Women: At <hi>Abbevilla</hi> they ſlew the Lord of <hi>Harcourt,</hi> and dragg'd ſome along the Streets with their faces in the Kennel. At <hi>Meux</hi> above Four Hundred Religious Citizens were ſlain, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Maids were openly raviſhed in the Streets, and market-places, Men, VVomen and Children were Maſſacred, the very <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts themſelves ſlaying divers with their own hands. At a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bar,</hi> the ſame if not worſe Villanies were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, for the Papiſts pull'd out the hearts of theſe poor Proteſtants, and moſt barbarouſly gnawed them with their Teeth, rejoycing that they taſted of an <hi>Hugonots</hi> heart. At another place ſeven Hundred Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were inhumanely maſſacred, and their nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bodies thrown into the River; Their Houſes and Church being likewiſe plundred and Burnt.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Angies</hi> they murthered a Godly Miniſter and many others and finding a Fair Bible guilt, they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107440:59"/> hung it upon an Halbert, and carried it in proceſſion, blaſphemouſly crying, <hi>Behold Truth hanged, the Truth of the</hi> Hugonots, <hi>The Truth of all the Devils; behold the Mighty God, behold the Everlasting God will ſpeak,</hi> and when they came to the Bridge, they threw it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River; crying lowder, <hi>Behold the Truth of all the Devils drown'd.</hi> At <hi>Tours</hi> an hundred and forty were murdered and caſt into the River, and neither Man, VVoman nor Child ſpared; nay the <hi>Preſident</hi> of the City being only ſuſpected to be a Favourer of the Proteſtants, was firſt beaten with Staves, then ſcript to his ſhirt, hang'd up by one Foot, his Head in the water up to the Breaſt, and whilſt he was yet alive, they ript up his Belly, pluckt out his Guts, threw them into the River, and ſticking his heart on a Lance, they carried it about, ſaying, <hi>This is the Heart of the</hi> Preſident <hi>of the</hi> Hugonots.</p>
            <p>A Poor VVoman whoſe Husband was a while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore drown'd, having a young Infant ſucking at her Breaſts; and a beautiful Daughter of about ſixteen years old in her hand, theſe bloody Villains drove them to a River, and taking the Daughter aſide, ſome of the Raſcals endeavoured to ſeduce her to Popery, and one of them who was finer then the reſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to marry her, ſo that the poor Maid began to doubt, which her Mother who was juſt going to be thrown into the River perceiving, ſhe earneſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted her Daughter to perſiſt in the Truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Daughter cryed out, <hi>I will live and dye with my Mother, whom I know to be a Virtuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and as for your Threats and promiſes I regard them not, do with me what you pleaſe:</hi> Before the Mother was quite drowned, the Daughter was likewiſe thrown in, who making toward her Mother, they mutually embraced each other, and ſo yielded up their Souls into the hands of God.</p>
            <p>In the ſame City of <hi>Yours,</hi> there was a very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107440:59"/> Woman, who being brought before the Captain, ſhe there gave an Account of her Faith, which ſhe confirmed by Scripture, inſomuch that the Fryers who diſcourſed with her, could not return any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but only told her, <hi>That ſhe was in a damnable condition: It ſeems ſo indeed</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>being in your hands:</hi> And being then committed to priſon, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her mind freely, and comforted the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Priſoners; ſhe was afterward condemn'd to be hang'd, and the Rope being put about her neck, ſhe kneeled down praiſing and magnifying the name of God in ſhewing her ſo much mercy as by that death to deliver her out of this wretched world, and that ſhe was ſo far honoured as to dye for the Truth, and to wear Gods Livery, as ſhe reckoned the halter to be; ſhe then brake her faſt with the reſt of the Company, and exhorted them to be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and to truſt in the free mercy of God to the end. As ſhe went to Execution one of her kindred brought her own little Children to ſee her, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded her to recant and ſave her life to provide for theſe Innocent Babes: This was a very great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and wrought ſo upon her Motherly Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as drew plenty of Tears from her Eyes; But a while after refuſing her former Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I love my Children dearly, yet neither for love to them, nor for any thing elſe in this World will I renounce my God, or his Truth; God will be a Father to theſe my Children, and will provide better for them then I could have done, and therefore to his Providence and protection I commend and leave them.</hi> After which ſhe went cheerfully to the place of Execution, and having there prayed to, and praiſed God, ſhe quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſigned up her Spirit to him.</p>
            <p>A while after the City of <hi>Roan</hi> was beſieged and two of the Forts taken, wherein they put all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to the Sword, and the Queen Mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107440:60"/> at the Siege, ſhe led the young King <hi>Charles the Ninth,</hi> who was then but twelve years old, to ſhew him the Naked Bodies of ſeveral poor Women; who weltred in their Blood; At laſt the City was taken, wherein all ſorts of monſtrous Cruelties were uſed, maſſacring all they met with, and divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Souldiers were hanged, and the Sick and wounded were caſt into the River.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Valogues</hi> divers Perſons of good Quality were maſſacred, and among the reſt, a Godly Miniſter whoſe body they ſtripped, and with many ſcoffs and ſcorns dragged it about the Houſe, and at laſt bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into a Room, where he uſed to preach, they kickt and ſpurn'd his Corps, ſaying, <hi>Now pray to God and preach if thou canst;</hi> The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts that were preſent, ſtuffed his Mouth and likewiſe his wounds with the Leaves of his Bible; crying, <hi>Preach the Truth of thy God, and call upon him now to help thee.</hi> In a place called <hi>Agen</hi> many were maſſacred, and two young Children were roſted: In the Caſtle of <hi>Rheims</hi> there was great Cruelty uſed, many young Children being murthered in their Mothers Arms; and the Mothers alſo ſhamefully abuſed, and afterward killed. Above five hundred men were hanged upon Gibbets, among whom was a grave Counſellor in his long Gown and ſquare Cap.</p>
            <p>In the City of <hi>Blois</hi> the Murtherers hearing there was a Sermon, brake violently into the houſe, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have taken the Miniſter, but being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, they dragg'd ſeveral Women that were there, by the hair of the head, and beating them ſeverely threw them into the River, but by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, they had ſo much ſkill as to ſwim ſafely to an Iſland, but preſently after ſome VVater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men finding them there, ſtript them ſtark naked, and threw them again into the River, yet ſtill they endeavoured to ſave themſelves, and Swum toward
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107440:60"/> the Suburbs of a Town called <hi>Vienne,</hi> and were they cruelly knocked on the head by the bloody Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. The <hi>French</hi> General having taken ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Priſoners, he hanged moſt of them, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Miniſters; among the reſt, there was a Captain, called <hi>La mothe</hi> to whom the General gave divers ſtabbs with a Dagger, and thruſt him thorough with a Sword, ſaying, <hi>Villain thou ſhalt dye in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of God;</hi> But he proved a Lyar; for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was carryed away, and though extreamely wounded, yet was wonderfully cured, and lived af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
            <p>Many horrible Murthers were likewiſe committed upon the Proteſtants, and amongſt others one of their Practices was to throw them down from the top of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Abby, which was built upon an high Rock, under which there ran a deep and ſwift Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and by the way there was another Rock which ſtood far out, upon which their bodies falling were daſht and torn to pieces: Among the reſt there was a young man, who ſeeing they were reſolved to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him, requeſted that he might thus caſt himſelf from the top of the Abby, and if it pleaſed God to preſerve him in the fall, he might eſcape with Life, this they promiſed, whereupon having made his Prayers to God, he fetched a leap from the top of the Abby and flew ſo far, that miſſing the Rocks under him, he fell into the River, and endeavoured to ſwim out for his life, but theſe perfidious Villains knockt him on the head, and killed him.</p>
            <p>A Captain and his Souldiers entring the Houſe of a Religious VVidow, they bound her with Cords, and then put a Rope about her neck, whereby ſhe was halled up and down, till ſhe was almoſt ſtrangled, they then asked her, <hi>How often ſhe had played the whore with thoſe of her Religion,</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>That in the Christian Meetings there were no ſuch Villanies
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107440:61"/> committed.</hi> The Captain then daſht her head againſt the walls till he had almoſt beaten out her brains, and required her to give him Seven Hundred pieces of Gold which ſhe had hidden, ſhe told him ſhe was a poor woman, and had only one <hi>French</hi> penny, this inraged him the more, and he thereupon apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hot burning Coals to her Arm-pits, till they were all bliſtred, bidding her in deriſion, to cry to her <hi>Father which was in Heaven,</hi> She replyed, <hi>I will not cry aloud for thee, and yet my God can hear me well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and when his pleaſure is, he will deliver me out of thy hand.</hi> This made him ſwear and blaſpheme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, which more afflicted the poor VVoman than her pains or ſufferings; and then he called her <hi>Hugonote</hi> whore, ſaying that theſe were but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her ſorrows, and except ſhe fetcht him out her Gold, he would draw her Cheeks and Breaſts with Lard and roaſt her alive, and afterwards throw her body head-long from the higheſt Steeple in the Town, <hi>well</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>if you throw my body never ſo low, that ſhall not hinder my Soul from aſcending into Heaven:</hi> This her courage did further inrage him, and thereupon he opened her Mouth with his Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and crammed Lime down her Throat, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards forced her to drink a glaſs of Urine which he had made before her, throwing the remainder with the glaſs in her Face, they then carryed her to their Quarters, and threatned to kill her with ſtrange Cruelties; but ſome pitying her condition redeemed her for ten Crowns, and conveyed her home, where ſhe ſoon dyed.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe Hell-Hounds conſtrained one <hi>Peter Roch</hi> to dig his own Grave, and then bid him try how it fitted him, which whilſt he was doing, they bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him alive. They ſtript a Gentlemans VVife ſtark Naked, and would have abuſed her, but ſhe reſiſting, they cruelly whipt her, crowned her with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107440:61"/> Thorns, wounded her with their ſwords, and then ſhot her to death. In another Town ſix of the chief men had their heads ſtruck off, and others were divers ways put to death. In <hi>Tholouſe</hi> ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors made Proclamation that they ſhould kill and deſtroy all thoſe of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and ſpare none, ſince they were Licenced to do it both by the King, and the Pope: This ſoon ſpread through all the Villages, and the Papiſts rang the Bells to the ſlaughter, and there preſently began a moſt horrible Maſſacre in thoſe parts; There were above Thirty Thouſand Proteſtants in the City of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> ſo that the Priſons were Immediately filled, and many knockt on the Head becauſe they would hold no more, the River was quickly covered with murdered bodies; ſome Proteſtants got into the Town-houſe, and made an agreement to depart quietly, but the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Papiſts deſtroyed moſt of them.</p>
            <p>At a Town called <hi>Carcaſſon</hi> they pulled out their Eyes, and cut off their Ears and Noſes; They took one and blacked his Hands, Face and Feet; and then ſaid he had a Devil, afterwards they hanged him, and threw his body to the Dogs; One being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to blaſpheme God, upon refuſal was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hewen to pieces. A Blackſmith becauſe he would not give himſelf to the Devil, they laid his head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Anvil, and beat out his brains with ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. A young Woman was found hid in a houſe with her Husband whom they raviſhed before his Face, and then forced her to take hold of a Rapier, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with one of the Villains thruſting her Arm, made her kill her own Husband.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Foix</hi> and <hi>Aurang,</hi> ſome had their hands and legs cut off, and were afterwards beheaded, others were carried upon Halberts, ſome were burnt in Churches, ſome had their Privities cut off; Girls
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107440:62"/> of Five and Six years old were Raviſhed and ſpoiled. In <hi>Ciſterno</hi> the men being fled, the Papiſts fell upon the VVomen and Children, and ſlew Three or Four Hundred of them; Some VVomen with Child were ript up, and many buried alive, ſome had their Throats cut like Sheep, others were drawn through the Streets and beaten to death with Clubs, and in brief the Proteſtants were murdered, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Age, Sex or Quality, neither Old, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, nor the diſeaſed in Hoſpitals being ſpared.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Maſion</hi> the bloody Papiſts apprehended an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Godly Miniſter, whom they carryed along the Streets, with a Thouſand Scoffs and Scorns, and beating and abuſing him, and then they made Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>That whoſoever would hear this Holy man Preach, ſhould come to the Slaughter Houſe:</hi> At which place they abuſed him two hours together; He then deſired that before his death, they would permit him to pray to God; upon which a Villain ſtept to him, and cut off half his Noſe, and one of his ears, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Now pray as long as thou wilt, and then we will ſend thee to all the Devils:</hi> And then this holy man kneeling down, prayed with ſuch zeal and fervency of Spirit, as drew ſighs from ſome of the Murderers, and afterwards ſpeaking to him that had cut off his Noſe, he ſaid, <hi>Friend I am now ready to ſuffer what thou haſt to inflict upon me, but I intreat you and your Companions to conſider ſeriouſly of the Miſchiefs and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages committed by you againſt this poor City, for there is a God in Heaven, before whoſe Tribunal you muſt ſhortly give an Account of theſe your Cruelties:</hi> Juſt then a Captain paſſing by, cryed, <hi>ſend that wretched man to the Devil;</hi> which one of them hearing took him by the hand, pretending to lead him to the River to waſh off his blood; but when he came thither, he threw him into the water, and then battered him with Stones till he was drowned.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:107440:62"/>
            <p>In the year 1571. after the end of the third Civil VVar in <hi>France,</hi> great means were uſed to draw the chief of the Proteſtants to <hi>Paris</hi> under the pretence of a Marriage that was between the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> who was a Proteſtant, and the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Siſter to the <hi>French</hi> King, but in the mean time ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were murdered in the City of <hi>Roan,</hi> as they came from a Sermon, which ſeemed very much to diſpleaſe the King, and divers were Executed for the Mutiny; then were the Articles of Marriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Admiral <hi>Coligni</hi> was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the VVedding, and thoſe that belonged to the Family of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> were forbid the Court, which was very acceptable to the Proteſtants, as judging it an aſſured pledg of the Kings fidelity, ſince he declared much ſatisfaction in the Marriage, ſaying, <hi>That it was not ſo much for the Wedding, as that it was a strong knot of Peace, and would be for the good of the whole Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Admiral for his ſecurity was allowed to bring with him fifty Gentlemen armed; and being come to <hi>Paris</hi> he was honourably received of the King, who called him Father, and proteſted that in his whole life, he had not been better pleaſed, as judging this day would end all his troubles, and ſettle firm peace and quietneſs in his Kingdom: Notwithſtanding this, the Admiral had ſeveral Intimations of ſome Treachery intended againſt him, but though very wiſe, yet he took little notice of it. The Queen Mother likewiſe entertained him with great favour, and the King ſent him One Hundred Thouſand Franks out of his Treaſury for the loſs which he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the VVars: And the King to delude the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpake publickly, <hi>That he did not give his Sister in Marriage to the King of</hi> Navar <hi>only, but as it were to the whole Church of the Proteſtants to joyn with them in an indiſſoluble union and as a tye to their peace and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:107440:63"/>
            <p>The Seventeenth of <hi>August,</hi> the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> were married with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity before the great Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> on a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in the ſight of all the People, by the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the King of <hi>Navars</hi> Unkle, and the VVed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was ſolemniz'd with Banquets, Dancing and Maſques, with a ſtrange mixture of Proteſtants and Papiſts together, after which the Bride was led into the Church to hear Maſs with great ſolemnity, but the King of <hi>Navar</hi> her Bridegroom, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and other Proteſtant Noblemen walked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church door, till her return, as miſliking their Religion and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Queen Mother, and her bloody Councellors, together with the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Guiſe</hi> contrive the Murder of the Admiral, and the dividing the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>The Admiral after the Marriage moved the King for his departure home, but the continual complaints of the Proteſtants ſtill detained him at Court, and going ſome days after th ther, in his return home while he was reading a Petition with divers Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen about him; He was ſhot by a Harquebuzie, the Bullet taking off the fore-finger of his right-hand, and hurting him in the left Arm, he feeling himſelf ſhot, ſaid, without alteration of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, <hi>It came through yonder Window, what kind of Treachery is this?</hi> The door of the Houſe being broke open, they underſtood that he which ſhot, preſently mounted upon a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jennet at a back door, and made his eſcape, leaving his Gun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and upon Examination it was found, that the Harquebuz was brought to the houſe the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by one <hi>Chally</hi> Steward of the Kings Houſe, and an acquaintance of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having notice of this Villany, ſeemed to be extreamely concerned, cauſing all the Gates
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107440:63"/> of <hi>Paris</hi> to be preſently ſhut, and ſwore to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Friends, that thoſe that had committed this horrid Fact ſhould not eſcape: the Queen Mother likewiſe ſeemed much diſcontented at it. The King went to viſit the Admiral, aſſuring him of his love and care over him. However the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and other Proteſtants had private advice to depart ſpeedily out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to look upon this but as the beginning of the Tragedy which was to follow; but they, truſting to the Kings word, would not go.</p>
            <p>The Dukes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Anjou</hi> imployed ſome to go to every houſe, and bring them a Catalogue of all the Proteſtants, and the King ſet a Guard of Fifty <hi>Harquebuzies</hi> at the Admirals Gate; and abundance of Arms were ſent into the Kings Pallace of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and in the Evening of the ſame day, all the Papiſts were in Arms; the Proteſtants obſerving all this, many of then aſſembled at the admirals Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where it was adviſed that the Admiral ſhould be Immediately conveyed out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the reſt ſhould change their Lodgings, but this was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed they ſtill relying upon the Kings word, who promiſed them Juſtice.</p>
            <p>In the Evening, divers Proteſtant Gentlemen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to watch with the Admiral, but he refuſed it, and the ſame night the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſent for the Captain of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and ſhewed him his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to kill the Admiral and the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and exhorted him and his Souldiers to be couragious in ſhedding their blood; At midnight the Provoſt, Sheriffs, and Captains of every Ward had the ſame Orders given them, with aſſurance, that the like ſhould be Executed upon the Proteſtants through the whole Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and that the Signal for the General Maſſacre, would be the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bell in the Kings Pallace, which would be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107440:64"/> about break of day, and that the Murderers ſhould have a white handkerchief tyed about their Arms, and a white Croſs in their hats, and Candles to be lighted in every houſe: At the time appointed, the Bell rung, and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> haſted to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Lodgings with his Cut-throats, and knocking at the Door, he that opened it was murdered; the Admiral hearing the noiſe, got out of his Bed, and there being a Miniſter in the Room, they both went to Prayers, and the Admiral fervently commended his Soul to God, and then ſaid to thoſe about him, <hi>It is long ſince I diſpoſed my ſelf to dye, ſave your ſelves if it be poſſible, for you cannot ſave my life, I commit my ſoul into the hands and mercy of God.</hi> The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the reſt of his attendants got up to the top of the houſe, and crept out of the Windows to ſave themſelves, yet moſt of them were ſlain in the next Houſe.</p>
            <p>Preſently ſeven or eight men broke into the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Lodgings, and one of them ſet his Naked Sword to his Breaſt, ſaying, <hi>Art thou the Admiral?</hi> To whom with a Chriſtian Conſtancy he anſwered, <hi>I am called ſo,</hi> and withal ſaid, <hi>young man thou oughteſt to conſider my Age and the weak condition I am now in, but do what thou wilt, for thou canst not ſhorten my life but a very little:</hi> But the Wretch blaſpheming God, thruſt him through the Breaſt, and afterward ſtrook him on the head, another ſhot him with a Piſtol, and a third wounded him in the Thigh, ſo that he lay gaſping for life; the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was below, and with a lowd voice cryed, <hi>Have you done?</hi> It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Yes;</hi> the Duke replyed, <hi>Our Chevalier</hi> (which was the Kings Baſtard Brother) <hi>will not believe it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſee it;</hi> which being done, his Face was all bloody, which the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> wiping, ſaid, <hi>Now I know it is he,</hi> and then kicked him on the Face with his Foot, whom all the Murtherers of <hi>France</hi> feared ſo much when he was alive.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:107440:64"/>
            <p>Then the Duke and his bloody Train went into the Streets, crying <hi>Arm, Arm, we have had good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and a happy beginning, Let us now proceed to the rest, for it is the Kings Command,</hi> which words he repeated often, <hi>This is the Kings Commandment, this is his Will, this is his expreſs pleaſure, therefore courage my Fellows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the great Bell of the Pallace which was the bloody token of the General Alarm, began to ring out alowd, and preſently a Report was ſpread, That the Proteſtants had conſpired againſt the King; Queen and Court, and were juſt going to Execute their Deſign; After this the Admirals head was cut off, and ſent to the King, and Queen Mother, and being by them preſerved with Spices, it was ſent to the Pope, and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> as a very grateful preſent. The Pope when he firſt heard the News of the Maſſacre, appointed a day of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Thankſgiving to God, where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung for joy in the Church of St. <hi>Lewes;</hi> He likewiſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Bull of Pardons and extraordinary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to ſuch as ſhould pray for the Heavenly aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the King and Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> for rooting out of Hereticks.</p>
            <p>The Raſcally Rabble cut off the Hands and Privy Members of the Admiral, dragging his mangled bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy beſmeared with blood and filth, through the Streets three days together, and then hanged it by the Feet upon the Gallows; All the Attendants of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> which lay in the Kings Pallace were murdered, and likewiſe all the Lords and Gentlemen about the Admiral's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and among the reſt his Son <hi>Teligny,</hi> and then through all the City and Suburbs were the poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Maſſacred with all manner of Cruelties; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was then to be heard but the Terrible noiſe of Horſes and Arms, Guns and Piſtols, mingled with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107440:65"/> the doleful, ſad and woful Schreeches and miſerable complaints of Men, VVomen, and Children, Rich and Poor, crying for mercy to theſe bloody Hell-hounds, howling and lamenting at their miſerable Condition, to bet hus wretchedly murdered for they knew not what: And all this intermixt with the groans of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the mercileſs ſhouts of the Cruel Murtherers, continually crying, <hi>kill, kill, for the King commands it,</hi> that it ſeemed as if Heaven and Earth had met together, or as if the Heavens had rent with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>So that in that night, and the Two next days there was ſlain in <hi>Paris</hi> above Ten Thouſand Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both Sexes, and all Ranks and Ages, the bloody Papiſts not ſparing the Children in the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, nor the Infants in their Mothers wombs, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Streets, Market-place, and Rivers were dyed with Blood, and the Murtherers boaſted that they had in a few days put an end to that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, that neither Pen, Paper, decrees of Juſtice nor open VVar could accompliſh in Twelve years.</p>
            <p>This horrid Maſſacre was committed on St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomews</hi> day, being the 24. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1571. which was the Sabbath day, and is made famous for ever, by the Effuſion of ſo much precious Innocent blood, as no Age nor time can parallel, for there were at this time in <hi>Paris</hi> Threeſcore Thouſand men, with Piſtols, Poinards, Swords, Knives, and ſuch other Bloody Inſtruments, who ran up and down, ſwearing and blaſpheming the Sacred Majeſty of God, cruelly maſſacring all they met, ſo that the Streets were covered with mangled Bodies, and the Gates and Doors defiled with blood, the Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were Inhumanely murdered, ſome in their Beds, others on the top of their Houſes, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places where they were found, and ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of dead Bodies, were thrown into the River <hi>Se-Sin,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:107440:65"/> that the water was dyed Red with their Blood.</p>
            <p>In the Helliſh Aſſembly wherein this bloody Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre was concluded on, it was debated whether the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with the reſt; the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> pleaded for it, but others were againſt it, and argued how abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable it would be to deſtroy two young Princes of the Blood, in the Flower of their Age, and one of them in the imbraces of his young Bride, and the Kings own Siſter, and therefore it was concluded, <hi>That they ſhould be threatned violently with death and all manner of Torments if they would not turn Papiſts,;</hi> And thereupon the King commanded them to be brought into his preſence, and told them, <hi>That now he had cut off all the Inſtruments of the late Civil Wars, which he hoped would prevent future troubles, for by his Command the Admiral was ſlain, and all the reſt of the Hereticks and that the like ſhould be Executed in all other places throughout the Kingdom, and that if they would now ſave their Lives they muſt turn Catholicks, for he was reſolved to have but one Religion in his Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeeched his Majeſty to <hi>Remember his Oaths, Promiſes, and ſolemn Vows and Proteſtations that they ſhould have the free Exerciſe of their Religion,</hi> and withal told the King, <hi>That he might do as he pleaſed with their Bodies and Eſtates, but their unſpotted Souls were in the hands of God; and that they were reſolved to remain ſtedfast in their Religion, though with the loſs of their lives;</hi> which anſwer ſo inraged the King, that he called the Prince of <hi>Conde Rebel,</hi> and <hi>the Son of a Rebellious Perſon,</hi> horribly threathing him, <hi>That if within three days he did not obey his Command he ſhould dye for it,</hi> and then with a furious Countenance left them with theſe three Terrible VVords, <hi>Death, Maſs or the</hi> Baſtile.</p>
            <p>Many Gentlemen that were attendants upon them,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107440:66"/> as likewiſe their School-Maſters and Tutors, were thruſt out of the Chamber among the Murtherers, that is among the Kings Guard of <hi>Switzers</hi> who ſtood in two Ranks with their Swords drawn ready for Blood and Cruelty. Theſe Gentlemen crying out of the Kings Oaths, Promiſes and Fidelity, were yet by the Kings Command, and in his own Sight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully hewen and cut in pieces.</p>
            <p>In this Butcherly Maſſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four Thouſand Houſes robbed and plundred, and above Five Hundred Barons, Knights and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who were chief Officers in the VVar, with abundance of Noble young Gentlemen, Ladies, and Gentlewomen Inhumanely murthered, who little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſuch a bloody Fate, for they came from all parts to rejoyce, in honour of the marriage of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and inſtead of Jollity and pleaſures, they here met with an untimely death, from Bloody and Cowardly Papiſts, who murther like Devils, but dare not fight like men.</p>
            <p>The King and his Confidents fearing that this Maſſacre would not end the Quarrel, but rather ſtir up the Proteſtants in other places to ſtand upon their own defence; He therefore ſends Meſſengers by Poaſt to all parts of the Kingdom, often ſhifting Horſes for more ſpeed, with expreſs Commands to the Governours of all other Towns and Cities in <hi>France</hi> to follow the Example of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and kill all the Proteſtants which were amongſt them; and yet at the ſame time, the King writes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letters wherein he laid the fault of the murder of the Admiral, and the reſt upon the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as this Command was publiſhed, and that the Kings Letters came, the Papiſts fell with all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable fury upon all the Proteſtants at <hi>Meaux, Troys, Orleans,</hi> and other places, murthering them
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107440:66"/> without any matter of pity and Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>And among the reſt Mounſier <hi>De la Place,</hi> Preſident of the Court of Requeſts being in his houſe, a Captain came to him, and told him, that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had killed the Admiral by the Kings Appointment, and many other <hi>Hugonots,</hi> but however he was willing to ſecure him, but deſired to ſee his Gold; The Lord <hi>De la Place</hi> obſerving his Impudence asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought there were a King or no; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain blaſpheming bid him go to know the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; The Lord <hi>De la Place</hi> thinking there was danger neer, went from him to ſecure himſelf, and the Captain thereupon plundred his Houſe. The poor Gentleman ſeeking ſhelter in three Houſes for his life, was denied, and was at laſt forced to return home again, where finding his wife very ſorrowful, he rebuked her, and diſcourſt with her of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, telling her, <hi>That through many Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> and then calling his Family together, he made an Exhortation to them, went to prayer, and then read a Chapter in <hi>Job,</hi> with <hi>Calvins</hi> Expoſition, and then praying again, he reſolved by Gods aſſiſtance to ſuffer all Torments rather than to fly for it.</p>
            <p>Preſently after the <hi>Provost</hi> of the Merchants comes to his Houſe with many Archers, and an Order to bring him to the King, and would not admit of any Excuſe, whereupon the Lord ſuppoſed what would happen, and therefore embracing his Wife, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her never to forſake the truth of God; And ſo going toward the Palace, ſome Murtherers waited for him, and Immediately ſtab'd him with their Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſo that he fell down dead, and then ſtripping him, caſt his Body into the River.</p>
            <p>After this, there followed the like Cruelties and Murders upon the Proteſtants in the Cities of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tholouſe, Burdeux, Angiers,</hi> where the Proteſtants
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107440:67"/> were moſt barbarouſly kild and deſtroyed, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in moſt other Cities and Towns, ſo that in a few Months there were murdered above threeſcore Thouſand Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> for no other Crime, but only for being Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Yet in the midſt of theſe dangers it pleaſed God to provide ſome places of refuge for them, as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, Montalbon, Wiſmes, Saucerre, Privas,</hi> &amp;c. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many Proteſtants fled from other places. In the year 1573, the Town of <hi>Saucerre</hi> was beſieged by the Lord of <hi>Chastre,</hi> who with his Canon played inceſſantly upon the place, ſo that the Stones, Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Splinters of Timber flew about continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and yet it pleaſed God that only one young VVoman was ſlain thereby, though ſometimes the Coats, Breeches, and Hats of the Inhabitants were ſhot thorough; The Siege being long, there was great ſcarcity, inſomuch that the People were forced to eat Horſes, Aſſes, and Mules, which laſted a Month; Afterwards they eat all the Dogs, Cats, Rats, Mice and Moles that they could get; and then they were forced to eat Parchments, Horſes, and Beaſts-Hoofs, Horns, Lanthorns, Halters, Girdles of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Herbs, wild Roots, and Furniture for Horſes; this being all ſpent, and no bread in the City, they made bread of <hi>Linſeed,</hi> Herbs mixt with Bran, Straw-Meal, Powder of Nut-ſhells; yea Slates, Sewet, Old Ointments, and other Greaſe ſerved to make Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and therewith, they likewiſe fryed the the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of Horſes and Men, which they eat, yea the very filth in the Streets was not ſpared.</p>
            <p>During this Extremity, a labourer and his wife were put to death for eating the Head, Intrials and Brains of their own Child, a Girl of three years old, who died with Famine, having likewiſe dreſſed the reſt of her body to eat at other times. Thoſe that went out of the City VValls, were forced to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107440:67"/> the Spriggs of Vines, Black-beries, Snails, and Herbs; and many of them were killed by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And among other lamentable Spectacles, a poor man and his Wife were found dead among the Vines, and two of their Children crying by them; the youngeſt being not above Six weeks old, whom a Charitable Widow took home and relieved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many dyed of this terrible Famine in their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and others fell down dead in the Streets; Moſt of the Children under Twelve years old dyed, and moſt lamentable it was to ſee their poor Fathers and Mothers lamenting their miſery, and yet could not relieve them; yet moſt of them did wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themſelves in Gods help and aſſiſtance, as may appear by this ſtrange Example.</p>
            <p>A Boy about five years old being famiſht for Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, running along the Streets, fell down for dead in the preſence of his Father and Mother, who wept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, and felt his Arms and Legs, which were as dry as a Stick: To whom the Child ſaid, <hi>Why do you weep to ſee me dye of hunger? I ask you no Bread Mother, for I know you have none, but ſince it is Gods will that I ſhould dye in this manner, I must take it thankfully; Had not the Holy man</hi> Lazarus <hi>Hunger, have</hi> I <hi>not read it in my Bible?</hi> and ſaying thus, he yielded up his Spirit.</p>
            <p>And that which preſerved the reſt from periſhing was, becauſe there were ſix Cows kept alive to give Milk to ſome few Infants, and ſome Horſes of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice referred for extremity were killed, and their fleſh ſold, and ſome little Corn was brought into the Town by ſtealth, which was ſold for half a Crown a pound.</p>
            <p>There dyed by the War but Eighty four Perſons, but the Famine deſtroyed Five Hundred, and the reſt were brought ſo low, that they hardly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Divers voluntarily went out of the Town chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107440:68"/> rather death then ſuch miſery, whereof ſome were ſlain, and others Impriſoned, and Executed.</p>
            <p>And now when all humane help failed, the King having ſworn, <hi>He would make them eat one another,</hi> and the Papiſts threatning to Maſſacre them all; it Pleaſed God ſtrangely to deliver theſe poor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. For Ambaſſdors coming from <hi>Poland</hi> to fetch the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> the Kings Brother thither, whom they had choſen for their King; They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of this terrible ſiege, obtained by their Solicitations, that all the Towns in <hi>France</hi> which were moleſted for Religion ſhould have their Liberty, by which means the poor <hi>Saucerreans</hi> half dead with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger obtained their fredom, and were quietly ſuffered to depart with their Arms and Goods, and thoſe that would ſtay not to be queſtioned for what was paſt.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time the Town of <hi>Rochel</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe beſieged, the Townſmen often ſallying out, and divers hot ſkirmiſhes paſt; among the reſt a young Gentleman boaſted with horrible blaſphemies, that he was one of the horrible Murderers of the Admiral, ſhewing his Sword, which he ſaid he brought from that exploit, to ſlaſh the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> but upon Tryal his heart failed him and he ran away, and one of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers</hi> purſuing him ſlew him, ſtript him, and left his body in the Field, and before next morning the had torn his Face.</p>
            <p>In one Months ſpace the Papiſts diſcharged above Thirteen Thouſand Shot againſt the Town, and made many aſſaults, but always came off with loſs, The Siege continued two Months, and the Famine much increaſeh upon them, but by Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when all other Proviſion failed them, there came a multitude of ſmall Fiſhes into the Haven, which were never ſeen there before, and was a very great relief to them, who continued during the ſiege, but preſently after the publiſhing the Edict of Peace,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107440:68"/> they went away and were never ſeen more. A while after the <hi>Rochellers</hi> were likewiſe freed from the ſiege by means of the <hi>Poland</hi> Ambaſſadors and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed their ormer Privileges: It is very remarkable that moſt of thoſe Perſons which were employed in the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris</hi> and other Places, were killed at this ſiege, for there were ſlain before this Town Three <hi>Maſters de Camp,</hi> divers Lords and Gentlemen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Threeſcore Captains, as many Lieutenants and Enſigns, and above Twenty Thouſand Common Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The next year after, the King himſelf, who was at leaſt the Countenancer of all theſe horrible Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, being in the prime of his Youth, not above Twenty five years old, fell ſick of a languiſhing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; his Phyſicians let him blood and purged him to no purpoſe; for he conſumed away ſo ſtrangely, as aſtoniſhed many. He long ſtrugled againſt his Diſeaſe, but at laſt betook himſelf to his Bed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fourteen days before his death, and was ſore tormented with a great Effuſion of blood, which iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all parts of his body, and one time, to the terror of thoſe about him, he rouled himſelf in his own blood; A while before he died he deſired his Mother to purſue his Enemies to the utmoſt repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, and with great eagerneſs, and ſaying <hi>Madam I pray you heartily to do it,</hi> and ſo expired <hi>May</hi> 30. 1574.</p>
            <p>And it was obſerved that the reſt of the Chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents were ſtrangely cut off; The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> the Kings Brother, afterwards King <hi>Henry the Third</hi> was ſtabbed by a <hi>Jacobine</hi> Monk in the ſame Chamber where he ſate in Councel for contriving the late Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies. The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> was murdered in the Kings own Chamber, Five and Forty Perſons wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Swords and Daggers to do it; The Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther broke her heart, and dyed the firſt of <hi>January</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:107440:69"/> after: And in ſhort, it hath been obſerved by a good Author, that ſince the year of our Lord 1560 of a Thouſand Murderers that remained unpuniſhed by men, there was not ten who eſcaped the Divine hand of God; but came to deſerved and wretched Ends, ſuitable to their bloody and wicked Lives.</p>
            <p>At a Town called <hi>Sanſay</hi> in <hi>France</hi> in the year 1593, one <hi>Margaret Pieron</hi> was by her maid accuſed to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> for not going to Maſs, and for keeping a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in her houſe, who complaining thereof to the Judges, they ſent for her, and ſaid, Margaret, <hi>are you not willing to return home to your houſe, and there enjoy your Husband and Children? Yes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>if it may ſtand with the good will of God;</hi> Then ſaid they, <hi>If thou wilt do but a ſmall matter thou ſhalt be ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; If,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>if it be not contrary to Gods glory and my own Salvation, you ſhall hear what I will ſay to it. No ſuch thing,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>for all that we require is but this, That a Scaffold being ſet up in the chief part of the Town, you ſhall there crave pardon for offending the Law, and a fire being made you ſhall burn your Bible in it without ſpeaking a word. I pray you my Masters</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>tell me is my Bible a good Book or no? Yes,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>we confes it is, only to pleaſe the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>we would have thee throw it in the Fire, Imagine it to be but Paper, and then you may burn it, and you may buy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at any time, and thereby you may ſecure your Life.</hi> They ſpent two Hours in perſwading her that ſhe might commit a leſs Evil to do a greater good. But ſhe couragiouſly anſwered them, <hi>That by the help of God ſhe would never do it. Will not the People ſay</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>This is a wretched Woman indeed, that burns the Bible, wherein all the Articles of Chriſtian Religion are contained? I will certainly burn my Body, rather then I will burn my Bible.</hi> Upon this ſhe was committed to Priſon, and fed only with bread and water, and her Friends forbad to come to her, but continuing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107440:69"/> ſtedfaſt in the Truth, ſhe was thereupon condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſet upon a Scaffold, to have the Bible burnt before her Face, her ſelf to be ſtrangled, and her body to be dragged through the Streets to a Dunghil, which Sentence ſhe willingly and cheerfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went.</p>
            <p>In the year 1628. The City of <hi>Rochel</hi> was again beſieged with a great Army by the <hi>French</hi> King, whereby the Inhabitants were in ſuch extremity for want of Victuals, that rhey eat Horſes, Dogs Cats, Rats, and Mice, and after that the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> lived Two Months upon Cow-hides and Goat-skins boyled. They likewiſe eat old Gloves, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was made of Leather, yea the poor people cut off the buttocks of the dead and eat them, young Maids of Fourteen or Sixteen years old looked like old Women of an Hundred years old, a Buſhel of Wheat was ſold for Twenty Pound, a Pound of Bread Twenty Shillings, a Quarter of Mutton above ſix Pound, An Egg eight ſhillings, An Ounce of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Half a Crown, a dryed Fiſh Twenty Shillings, a Pint of Milk Thirty Shillings. After a while the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was taken, and ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were therein, when they came aboard, looked like Anatomies or dead Bodies.</p>
            <p>And ſince that to this very day the Proteſtants have ſuffered very great hardſhips and Perſecutions in <hi>France</hi> by having their Churches pulled down, by Fires and Impriſonments, and Baniſhments, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluded from all Officer and Imployments of Truſt or Profit, and by all manner of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whatſoever, and that only upon the Account of their Religion; and all this contrary to Oat, hs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, Edicts and Proclamations, which have been ſolemnly made, and granted to them for the free Exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>

            <head>The Cruelties of the Papiſts in <hi>Italy, Spain, Portugal,</hi> and the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</head>
            <p>LEt us next proceed to look into <hi>Italy,</hi> which being under the Inſpection of the Pope, it may well be ſuppoſed not to harbour many Proteſtants, at leaſt ſuch as dare openly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſuch, by reaſon of the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which was firſt Inſtituted againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> but is now only uſed for the diſcovery, and Tormenting of good Chriſtians; yet not withſtanding all this, there have been divers who have owned the Goſpel even in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and ſeveral other places in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in the time of Pope <hi>Adrian the Fourth</hi> who was an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> one <hi>Arnald</hi> of <hi>Brixia</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> and preached publickly and boldly againſt the Corruptions of the <hi>Romi h</hi> Church; and found great favour among the Senators and People, inſomuch that when the Pope commanded them to drive <hi>Arnal,</hi> out of the City for an Heretick, they reſiſted his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and defended <hi>Arnald,</hi> upon which the Popo thundred out an Excommuncation againſt the whole City of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that upon the importunity of the Clergy they were forced to ſend him away; but he was entertained by the Lords of <hi>Campania</hi> who were ſubject to the Emperour, of <hi>Germany</hi> with whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and preached the Goſpel to them.</p>
            <p>The Emperour coming afterwards into <hi>Italy</hi> to be Crowned the Pope deſired him to deliver up <hi>Arnald</hi> into his hands; whereupon the Emperour ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of the Lords of <hi>Campania,</hi> which ſo terrified the other, that he delivered up <hi>Arnald,</hi> who being
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107440:72"/> ſent to the Pope he uſed him moſt cruelly, and then ordered him firſt to be hanged, and then burnt as an Arch Heretick; His Chief Hereſies were, <hi>That he preached against the Pride and Covetouſneſs of the Monks and Clergy, that he inveighed against the Errors in the Sacrament, that he expounded the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the year 1546. there was one <hi>Eucenas</hi> or <hi>Drian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> born, who being bred up in <hi>Rome,</hi> yet came at laſt to the knowledge of the Truth, and having diſcovered his diſlike of the falſe Doctrine of Popery, he was betrayed by his own Countreymen and Acquaintance, and being brought before the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, he was committed cloſe Priſoner, and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards brought forth to declare his Judgment where he gave a Notable Teſtimony to the Truth, upon which, when he refuſed to recant the ſame, he was condemned to be burnt, and ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with great patience and conſtancy.</p>
            <p>In the year 1550, One <hi>Faninus</hi> of <hi>Ferrara</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> being by the Grace of God and reading of good books converted to the Goſpel, and began to Inſtruct others privately therein, but this coming to the ears of ſome of the Popes Blood-hounds, they ſeized him and committed him to Priſon, where by the earneſt Importunities of his VVife, Children and Friends, he was perſwaded to deny the Truth, and was thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on releaſed out of Priſon; He had not been long at liberty, but he was extreamly troubled in mind, for preferring the Love of his Relations and Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt, neither could he by ny means be free from theſe Tortures till he had fully reſolved to venture his Life for the Goſpel; Being thus inflamed with holy Zeal, he went about the Countrey teaching and Inſtructing the People wherever he came.</p>
            <p>VVhereupon he apprehended and caſt into Priſon, and was condemned to be burnt, but he told his Judges, <hi>That his time was not yet come,</hi> and ſo it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107440:72"/> happened for he was removed to <hi>Ferrara</hi> where he continued in Priſon for Two years, and afterwards Eighteen Months in another Priſon, and was again condemned by the Popes Inquiſitors, but ſtill his death was one way or other prevented.</p>
            <p>His Wife and Siſter came to him in Priſon and weeping pitifully intreated him to remember and conſider his poor Family, To whom he anſwered, <hi>That his Lord and Maſter had commanded him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Truth for his Families ſake, and that it was too much that for their ſakes he had once fallen already, and therefore deſired them not to ſollicite him any more in that matter, for he knew his end drew neer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commended them to the Lord.</hi> In a ſhort time after the Pope ſent word <hi>Faninus</hi> ſhould be burnt, at which he very much rejoyced and thanked the Meſſenger. Being ſtill offered Life if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and thereby prevent the miſery of his Wife and Children, He ſaid, <hi>He would leave them to a careful and ſufficient Overſeer;</hi> and being aſked who that was, he anſwered <hi>even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Keeper of all that are committed to him.</hi> As he was going to Execution, one that ſaw him ſo merry and cheerful asked him, what the reaſon of it was, ſince Jeſus Chriſt before his death ſweat Water and Blood? To whom he anſwered, <hi>That Christ ſustained all the ſorrows and conflicts with Hell and Death, which were due to us, that by his ſufferings we might be free from the ſorrow and fear of them all.</hi> At the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation after having earneſtly prayed to God, he went patiently to the ſtake, and was firſt ſtrangled and then burnt.</p>
            <p>There was likewiſe one <hi>Dominicus</hi> a Souldier under <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who having received the Goſpel, grew ſo much in knowledg in a ſhort time, that he able to inſtruct others, whereupon he returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> and taught the People in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107440:73"/> Placentia,</hi> and ſeveral other places: In a little time after he was apprehended and readily obeyed the Magiſtrate, ſaying, <hi>That he wondred the Devil had let him alone ſo long;</hi> And being asked whether he would renounce his Doctrine, He ſaid, <hi>That he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no Doctrine of his own, but the Doctrine of Chriſt which he was alſo ready to ſeal with his blood;</hi> Being therefore condemned to death, he was brought into the Market-place, where he moſt heartily prayed for his Enemies, Inſtructed the People, and then was hanged, reſting in peace in the Lord.</p>
            <p>In the City <hi>Paria</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> one <hi>Galleacius Treci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> a Gentleman of good Quality, very rich, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to the poor embraced the Goſpel, for which being preſecuted he fled from thence, but being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards apprehended he was brought before the Lords <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> where he boldly and couragiouſly aſſerted the Truth; whereupon he was condemned to be burnt; next morning he was bound to a ſtake in the Market place, where he continued till noon to be gazed at by the People, during which time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Friends perſwaded him to recant, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could alter the firm mind of this conſtant Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr and Fire being put to him, be quietly ſlept in the Lord. A little before his Execution he heard there were ſome Differences between the Biſhop and the Mayor of the Town, who ſhould be at the coſt of wood to burn him, but to end the Quarrel he ſent them word he would be at the coſt out of his own Goods.</p>
            <p>In the year 1553 one <hi>John Mollius</hi> a famous Preacher was hanged and burnt for preaching the Goſpel, and the next year <hi>Francis Gamba</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned upon the ſame account, and becauſe he made adm rable diſcourſes to the People, his Tongue was bored through, and he was firſt ſtrangled, and then burnt, undergoing death with great patience
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107440:73"/> and Conſtancy. The next year after there was one <hi>Algerius</hi> a Student in <hi>Padua,</hi> a young man of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Learning, who having attained the knowledge of the Truth, he endeavoured by Example and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to bring in others, for which being accuſed of Hereſie, he was apprehended at <hi>Venice,</hi> and was afterwards ſent for to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny endeavours were uſed to tempt him to deſert and deny the Truth, which not prevailing, he was Condemned to be burnt alive; which he conſtantly ſuffered to the Admiration of all that ſaw him.</p>
            <p>In the year 1559. <hi>John Aloyſius</hi> a Miniſter, being ſent from <hi>Geneva</hi> to <hi>Calabria,</hi> was ſent for to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope, where he ſuffered Martyrdom, and at the ſame <hi>James Bovellus</hi> a worthy Miniſter was Martyred by the Popes Order at <hi>Meſſina.</hi> Pope <hi>Pius the Fourth</hi> raiſed an hot perſecution againſt the Proteſtants in all the Territories of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the deſtruction of many faithful Chriſtians, yea the Perſecution was ſo hot in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> that many Noblemen and their Wives, with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were ſlain. And a Papiſt writing to a Noble Lord about the Cruelties ſhewed to ſome Chriſtians in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria</hi> in the year 1560, hath theſe expreſſions, <hi>when I think upon it I verily quake and tremble, for their manner of putting to death may be fitly reſembled to the ſlaughter of Calves and Sheep, for Fourſcore and Eight of them being thruſt up together in one Houſe as in a Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, the Executioner cometh in, takes one and blindfolds him, and then leading him forth to a larger place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to kneel down, and then cuts his Throat; and leaving him half dead, he takes his Butchers Knife and Muffler all gore blood, and fetches the reſt, and ſo one after another diſpatches them all. How ſad this ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was I leave to your Lordſhip to Judge, for my own part I cannot but weep to think of it, neither were there any Spectators who ſeeing one to dye, could endure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107440:74"/> another, But truly ſo humbly and patiently they went to their deaths, as it almost incredible to believe: All the Aged Perſons went more cheerfully; the younger were ſomething more timerous, I tremble and ſhake to remember how the Hangman held his bloody Knife between his Teeth, and his bloody Muffler in his hand, and his Arms all gore blood up to the Elbows, going to the Fold, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of them one after another by the hand and ſo diſpatching them all, no otherwiſe then a Butcher doth his Calves and Sheep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Venice</hi> kept it ſelf free a long time from this Plague of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> ſo that multitudes of Chriſtians flocked thither from other places; but in the year 1542, the Pope ſo far prevailed as to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it there likewiſe, and then began a Terrible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the poor proteſtants there, and they found out a new kind of death for them, which was to drown them in the bottom of the ſea, in the manner following: when they were condemned to dye by the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> there was an Iron Chain faſtened round their waſt, and a heavy ſtone was tyed thereto, then they were laid upon a Planck between two Boats, and ſo rowed to an appointed place in the Sea where the Boats parting aſunder, the Perſon immediately ſunk into the Sea and was drowned; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which divers good Chriſtians met together, and had a Miniſter who preached the Goſpel and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred the Sacrament to them; but ſome falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren creeping in among them, betrayed them; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which many of them were apprehended and caſt into the Sea, others were impriſoned at <hi>Rome</hi> till they dyed.</p>
            <p>Among others who were condemned to be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Venice,</hi> there was one <hi>Seignior Anthony Ricetto;</hi> To whom after his condemnation his ſon of about Twelve years of Age came, and with Tears beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Father to recant, for the ſaving of his own
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107440:74"/> Life, and that he himſelf might not be left fartherleſs, To whom his Father anſwered, <hi>A good Christian is bound to forgo Children, goods, yea, and Life it ſelf for the maintenance of Gods Honour and Glory, for which cauſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I am now reſolved with Gods aſſiſtance to lay down my Life.</hi> When he came to the place where he was to ſuffer, the Stone and Chain were faſtned to him, whereupon lifting up his Eyes to Heaven, he ſaid, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do, Lord Jeſus into thy hands I do commend my Spirit;</hi> And ſo he ended his Life in the Sea.</p>
            <p>A while after one <hi>Francis Spinola</hi> was apprehended and committed to Priſon, and being called before the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> he boldly reproved the <hi>Popes</hi> Legate and the other Judges, in that c ntrary to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences they perſecuted the Truth of God, and told them they were the Off-ſpring of the <hi>Phariſees, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon he had ſentence paſſed upon him, <hi>That he ſhould be drown'd as an Heretick,</hi> to whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>I am no Heretick but the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> At which words the Popes Legate bid him be ſilent and told him <hi>That he lyed;</hi> The night after he was conveyed into the Sea and there drowned, bleſſing and praiſing God with invincible Conſtancy.</p>
            <p>In the year 1595, There was a young <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant at <hi>Rome,</hi> who going into a Church, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their groſs Idolatry he was ſo moved that he could not indure the ſight of thoſe impieties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Proceſſion paſſed by him, he ſtept to him that bare the Hoſt and Sacrament, and pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out of his hands, threw it on the Ground, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>ye wretched Idolaters, do ye fall down to a Morſel of Bread?</hi> This ſo provoked the People, that they were like to have torn him in Pieces, but he eſcaped death, and was ſent to Priſon, and complaint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being made to Pope <hi>Clement the Eight,</hi> he was ſo inraged that he commanded him to be burnt the ſame
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107440:75"/> day, but his Cardinals adviſed to have him kept in Priſon and Examined with Exquiſite Tortures who ſet him on; This they accordingly practiced, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting him with the utmoſt ſeverity, but could get nothing from him, but theſe words, <hi>Such was the will of God;</hi> Then was he adjudged to be led from the Capitol naked to his middle, and to wear on his head the form of a Devil, his breeches to be painted over with Flames of Fire, and ſo to be carryed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City, and then burnt alive.</p>
            <p>This was Executed upon him, and as he paſſed through the Streets he was mocked and derided of the People, but he prayed fervently to God, and at laſt uttered ſomething againſt the debauched Lives of the Cardinals, which ſo inraged them, that they gagged him; When he came before the Church where he threw down the Idol, his Right hand was cut off by the Hangman, and ſet upon a Pole in the Cart to which he was tyed; Then two Tormentors with flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Torches ſcorcht and burnt his Fleſh all the way, ſo that his body was all over bliſtred and bloody, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no part free but his head; then was he taken from the Cart, and went himſelf to the ſtake kiſſing the Chains that ſhould bind him. The Fryars urged him to worſhip an Idol, but he turned away his Face and ſhew'd his Deteſtation of it, and when the Fire ſeized on him, he bowed his head, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly reſigned up his Spirit to God.</p>
            <p>The ſame year there was an Ancient Religious man that had layn long in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> who was at laſt brought forth, and condemned, after which the Fryars brought a Crucifix to him, importuning him to kiſs and adore it, He ſeeing their Importunity, ſaid to them, <hi>If you take not this Idol out of my ſight,</hi> I <hi>ſhall ſpit upon it;</hi> The Fryars hearing this ſent him away immediately to the Fire, where with great Courage and Conſtancy he reſigned up his Spirit to God.</p>

               <head>Of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition.</head>
               <p>Since mention is often made of the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> It may not be amiſs to give a brief Account of the Original and Practice thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> having expelled the <hi>Moors</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Granada,</hi> who had inhabited there Seven Hundred Seventy Eight years, they reſ lved to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Religion, and granted the Conquered <hi>Moors</hi> Liberty to continue there, and enjoy their Goods if they would turn Chriſtians, and becauſe there were many <hi>Jews</hi> that had likewiſe continued there ever ſince <hi>Titus</hi> conquered <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they had alſo leave to remain there upon the ſame Conditions, but all that refuſed were commanded preſently to go out of <hi>Spain,</hi> Yet afterwards obſerving that thoſe who ſtaid were only Chriſtians in name, and had ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted meerly to ſave their Eſtates, inſtead of providing Religious men, who with Gentleneſs and meekneſs might inſtruct and reduce them from their Errors, they by the advice of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryars, erected a Court of <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> whereby the poor wretches inſtead of Inſtruction were robbed of all their Eſtates, and either put to moſt cruel deaths, or elſe ſuffered intolerable whippings and other Tortures; and ſpent the reſt of their lives in ſhame and miſery: neither was this only Inflicted upon ſuch as blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, but for obſerving the leaſt <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Ceremony, or holding the ſmalleſt Error in the Chriſtian Religion. But this <hi>Holy Inquiſition</hi> (as they call it) which was firſt erected againſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> was afterwards turned againſt the faithful Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, and for ſuppreſſing the Goſpel and the True Profeſſors thereof; and thus you have briefly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107440:76"/> the Original of it, let us a little obſerve the Method of their proceeding therein.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as Information is given againſt any Perſon they do not preſently cite the party to appear before them, but ſend one of their Informers, who taking opportunity to meet with him, uſually greets him thus, <hi>Sir</hi> I <hi>was yeſterday by Accident at my Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, who ſaid than they had occaſion to ſpeak with you about certain Affairs, and therefore they command me to ſummon you to appear before them to morrow at ſuch an Hour.</hi> The party not daring to refuſe goes to the place and ſends in word, <hi>That he is come to attend them;</hi> and being called in, the Inquiſitors ask him <hi>What ſuit he hath to them,</hi> And when he Anſwers <hi>That he is come upon ſummons;</hi> they enquire his Name, (<hi>For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we know not whether you be the man, but ſince you are come, if you have any thing to inform the Court of, either concerning your ſelf or any other, you may let us hear it for the diſcharge of your Conſcience.</hi> Now in this Caſe it is the ſafeſt way conſtantly to deny that he hath any thing to declare to them; For if through ſimplicity a man doth accuſe himſelf or any other, they rejoyce, as having attained their deſires, and ſo preſently commit him to Priſon.</p>
               <p>If any chance to make his eſcape, they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny devices to fetch him and find him again, one of them is by making his picture to the Life, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it about by their Apparators and Promoters, who are commonly the greateſt Villains in the Countrey, and will ſwear any thing againſt the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>After the Priſoner has been ſix or eight Months in Gaol, he is brought before the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> who tell him that they have deeply conſidered his caſe, and have found that he doth not declare the whole Truth, and therefore they are reſolved <hi>he ſhall be rackt,</hi> that they may draw from him by force, what by fair means he will not acknowledge, and then they adviſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107440:76"/> him rather to confeſs voluntarily and thereby avoid that pain and daanger that attends him; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he confeſs or not, it is the ſame thing, for to the rack he muſt go, to be compelled to confeſs more.</p>
               <p>Then is the poor Priſoner led into a deep and dark Dungeon under Ground where the Rack ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, paſſing through many doors before he come to it, becauſe the terrible cryes and ſchreiks of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſhould not be heard. Then the Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors ſet themſelves upon a Scaffold hard by the Rack, and the Torches being lighted, the Hangman or Tormenter comes in, all cloathed from Head to Foot in black Canvas, and a long black hood like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which covereth his Face, having only two holes in it to look out at, which ſight doth many times very much affright the poor Soul, to ſee one in the likeneſs of a Devil come to Torment him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> being ſeated near him, again per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwad him to confeſs freely and Voluntarily, and then with very ſharp words command him to be ſtript ſtark naked, yea though it be the modeſteſt Virgin or chaſteſt Matrone in the Countrey, whoſe grief is not ſo much the pain as to be ſeen naked by ſo many perſons, and yet theſe wicked Villains, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard of honeſty, will not by the utmoſt prayers, or Intreaties of the moſt virtuous Women or Maidens, be perſwaded to forbear one jot of this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Impudence; As if a Shirt or Shift could hinder the Rack from cruelly tormenting them.</p>
               <p>The party being ſtript naked, the Lords <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> ſignify their pleaſure how they will have him Tormented, and the firſt kind of Torment is uſually the <hi>Gibbet</hi> or <hi>Pully;</hi> Firſt one comes hehind him, and binds his hands together with a Cord Eight or Ten times about, and then his Thumbs in the ſame manner, the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> bidding him every time to bind them harder then other, and then both hands
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107440:77"/> and Thumbs are faſtned to a Pully which hangs to the Gibbet, they then faſten great and heavy bolts to his heels, and hung upon thoſe bolts divers Iron weights, and ſo hoiſe the poor wretch up from the ground: Having continued thus for ſome time they let him down, and hang twice as much more to his heels, and then hoſing him up, they let him ſlip half way down of a ſudden, which rends and tears Arms, Shoulders, Back, Leggs, and all his whole body out of joynt, by reaſon of the ſudden lirk, and the weights hanging at his heels.</p>
               <p>If the party ſhreik or cry out, they roar out as faſt and call him <hi>Heretick Rogue and Dog,</hi> and if in his cruel pangs he call upon Jeſus Chriſt for his aid and aſſiſtance, they mock and deride him, ſaying, <hi>Why calleſt thou on Jeſus Chriſt? Let Jeſus Chriſt alone and tell us the Truth,</hi> &amp;c. After they have tormented him about three hours; the Inquiſitors ask the Hangman whether the reſt of his Inſtruments of Torment are ready, who to affright the Priſoner anſwers, They are, but he hath not brought them with him: they then bid him bring them to morrow, and ſo turning to the poor wretch which lyes in miſerable pain, the Inquiſitors cry, <hi>How now Sirrah, how do you like this, well, conſider of it against to morrow or elſe you dye, for what you have felt, is but a flea-biting to what remains behind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Gaoler plays the Boneſetter as well as he can, three days after brings him to the Rack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when his joynts are moſt ſore, and ſometimes they have another Torment with the Trough, where the Perſon is laid with his feet higher then his head, bound hand and foot in the Trough, and then laying a thick Cloth over his Mouth and Noſtrils, they power water thereupon with a long ſtream, which falling from on High, drives the Cloth down his Throat, with miſerable Torture and pain, and being
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107440:77"/> drawn out again from the bottom of his Throat, it draws forth blood with it, and ſeems as if it tore out his bowels.</p>
               <p>They have another Torment with Fire, which is no whit inferiour to the former, and that is by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Priſoners Feet over a pan of burning Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, and that the Fire may have the more force, they baſt their Feet with Lard and Bacon.</p>
               <p>If after all theſe and divers other cruel Tortures they continue conſtant, they are then condemned to death, Then he is cloathed in a <hi>Sambernetto</hi> or long Garment painted over with ugly Devils; he hath on his head a high Crown'd Hat, whereon a man is paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed burning in the Fire, with many Devils about him, plying him with Fire and Faggot; upon his Tongue a piece of cleft wood is put to hinder his ſpeaking, a Cord about his Neck, and his hands faſt tyed behind him.</p>
               <p>All things being finiſhed, they are delivered by the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> into the hands of the Magiſtrate who preſently conveys him to Execution, where ſeveral Fryars ſwarm about him earneſtly perſwading him to deny the Truth, and when they cannot prevail upon him, he is tyed to the ſtake, and in an Inſtant the Hangman breaks his neck, without being perceived, and then they report among the Common People, that he recanted at his laſt hour, and returned to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore he felt no pain in the Fire, but took his death ſo patiently without any motion, or crying out.</p>
               <p>And though by the Terrors of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> the Profeſſors of the Goſpel in <hi>Spain</hi> have been but few, they having been ſo wickedly induſtrious as to cruſh all appearances of Truth in the bud; yet in the year 1545 ſeveral Proteſtants at St. <hi>Lucar, Valedolid, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> and other places in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuffered death, no leſs then thirty being Martyred at one time, and five
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107440:78"/> years after, divers more likewiſe were put to death, as one <hi>Francis Romanes,</hi> a Merchant; <hi>De Cacalla</hi> a man of Excellent Learning, and one <hi>Rochus</hi> a skilful Graver of Images, who turned Proteſtants and died for the ſame; alſo one <hi>John Pontio Gónſalvo a Prieſt, Juliano, Leon, Arias Loſada</hi> a Phyſician; Together with a Lady and ſeveral VVomen and Virgins who were burnt at ſeveral times in divers places, and Twenty others beſides who were burnt in one Fire: after they had endured all the horrid torments of the <hi>Rack,</hi> the <hi>Pully,</hi> the <hi>Trough,</hi> the <hi>Barnacle,</hi> the <hi>Twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cord,</hi> and the reſt of the barbarous Tortures and Inventions of the curſed <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> Nay divers <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> men being betrayed by the Inſinuation of wicked Informers were likewiſe burnt in <hi>Spain,</hi> as <hi>Nicholas Burton</hi> Merchant of <hi>London</hi> was burnt at <hi>Sevil,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Engliſh</hi> man with him, and not long after two more named <hi>John Baker</hi> and <hi>Villiam Burgate,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time <hi>William Burges</hi> Maſter of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship was burnt there likewiſe, and one <hi>William Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> a youth of about ſixteen years old, was ſtoned to death for the bold profeſſion of the Truth.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Portugal</hi> is but a little Kingdom, and the power of the Pope and his Clergy very conſiderable there as well as in <hi>Spain,</hi> they have wonderfully ſuppreſt the power of the Truth with their Tortures, yet ſome have their likewiſe ſuffered for the Goſpel, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others <hi>William Gardner</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, whom they put to death with moſt exquiſite Tortures at <hi>Lisbon</hi> in the year 1552, for taking the Hoſt out of a Cardinals Hand, and ſtamping it under his Feet; He boldly aſſerting to the King himſelf, <hi>That he did it out of Conſcience, as not being able to endure to ſee the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper irreverently uſed to ſo great Idolatry;</hi> and although all manner of cruelty was uſed toward him, yet he dyed with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſtancy, ſinging Pſalms in the Flames to the very laſt moment of his life.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:107440:78"/>
               <p>The Rage and Fury of Papiſts in the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> or <hi>Netherlands</hi> was no leſs then in other places. For the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> being introduced there, it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all manner of cruelty. At <hi>Antwerp</hi> one <hi>Nicholas</hi> an Holy good man was bound up in a Sack and drown'd. In <hi>Holland</hi> a Learned Preacher cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pistorius</hi> was burnt, being carryed to the ſtake with a Fools Coat on his back. <hi>Wendel muta</hi> a Widow likewiſe ſuffered death with much Conſtancy. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Miniſters were beheaded, among the reſt one <hi>George Scherter,</hi> who after his head had been cut off for ſome time, and his body lying on his Belly, he turning himſelf on his Back, and croſſing his Right Foot over the left, and his right hand over the left continued ſo to the great admiration of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the Converſion of many.</p>
               <p>Several were drowned, others were made away in Priſons, others ſhut up in dark and noiſom places, and none ſuffered to come at them; being fed only with Bread and Water till they were famiſhed; At <hi>Lorain</hi> ſeveral were Martyred, ſome by Fire, others beheaded.</p>
               <p>There was a very great Perſecution all over <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> about the year 1544; ſo that there was hardly a Town or City in all the Countrey wherein ſome were not baniſhed, beheaded, or condemned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Impriſonment, neither was there any reſpect either to Age or Sex, but eſpecially at <hi>Gaunt</hi> many of the chief Perſons were burned for being Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and ſeveral others in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Two Hundred Men and VVomen were cruelly deſtroyed at one time, ſome of them being drowned, ſome burned alive, and ſome privately murdered, ſo that the Hangman began to be tyred and wearied out with ſuch continual Executions.</p>
               <p>At the Town of <hi>Mecklin, Dornick</hi> and <hi>Delden,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral were put to death, and among the reſt two
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107440:79"/> Noble Virgins who were Siſters; and likewiſe a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and her three Sons who all dyed, owning the Goſpel, and zealouſly exclaiming againſt the Cruelty and Idolatry of the <hi>Papists;</hi> And about the ſame time they miſerably tormented one <hi>Bertrand</hi> for trampling the Hoſt under his Feet, whom they thrice put to the Rack, and becauſe he would not recant in the Market place of <hi>Dornick,</hi> they put a Ball of Iron into his Mouth to keep him from ſpeaking, and then cruſhed his Right hand between two flat Red hot I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons till the form of it was changed, and then did the like by his Foot, which he endured with admirable patience, then tying him round the waſt by a Pully, and making a Fire underneath, they hoiſted him up and down till he was burnt to Aſhes, which they caſt into the River.</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral Martyred at <hi>Valence,</hi> and <hi>Liſle</hi> and one of the Judges pronouncing ſentence againſt theſe good People, ſaid, <hi>This Day you ſhall go to dwell with all the Devils in Hell Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the greateſt Inſtrument of the Devil in thoſe Countreys was the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who was ſent by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to Root the Proteſtants out of the Low-Countreys. This Duke boaſted one time at his own Table, <hi>That he had been diligent to root out Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; for beſides thoſe he had ſlain in the Wars, He had put into the hands of the Common Hangman to be Executed within the ſpace of ſix years no leſs then Eighteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Perſons</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to complete this ſad <hi>Catastrophe</hi> we may alſo remember that <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſtaw</hi> Prince of <hi>Orang</hi> was ſhot by a Villain called <hi>Joanville,</hi> who was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by a <hi>Jacobine</hi> Fryar to do it; the Raſcal was thruſt through with an Halbert, and the Fryar was hang'd: But this wound not proving mortal, they hired one <hi>Gerard</hi> a <hi>Burgundion,</hi> who ſtanding behind the Pillar in a Room, ſhot the Prince dead as he paſt by.</p>

Mr. <hi>George Wiſchard</hi> a Famous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter was ſent for to appear before Cardinal <hi>Beton</hi> and the other Biſhops at St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> where a Prieſt was ordered to curſe him, who called him <hi>Runnagate, Traitor, Thief,</hi> &amp;c. However Mr. <hi>Wiſchard</hi> gave them an account of his Faith and Doctrine, but they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to anſwer him, immediately condemned him to be Burnt; and preſently a fire was prepared over againſt the Caſtle, and Velvet Cuſhions were laid in the Caſtle windows for the Cardinal and the reſt of the Prelates to ſee him ſuffer; and for fear he ſhould be reſcued by his Friends, all the Caſtle Guns were mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the place of his Execution, by the Cardinals order; then with a Rope about his Neck, and a Chain about his middle he was faſtned to the Stake; and having earneſtly prayed, and Exhorted the People, and forgiven his Enemies and perſecutors, he ſaid thus: <hi>I Beſeech you Brethren Exhort your Prelates to learn the Word of God, that they may be aſhamed to do evil, and learn to do good, or elſe there ſhall come upon them the Wrath of God, which they ſhall not eſchew:</hi> Then the Hangman upon his knees ſaid, <hi>Sr, I pray forgive me, for I am not the cauſe of your Death.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wiſchard</hi> called him to him and kiſſing his Cheek ſaid, <hi>Lo here is a token that I forgive thee, My Heart do thing Office;</hi> and ſo he was tyed to the Stake and the fire kindled.</p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:107440:82"/>
            <p>The Captain of the Caſtle came to him, and bid him be of good Courage; to whom Mr. <hi>Wiſchard</hi> ſaid, <hi>This fire Torments my Body, but no whit abates my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> then looking towards the Cardinal he ſaid, <hi>He who in ſuch State from that high place feeds his eyes with my Torments, within few dayes ſhall be hanged out at the ſame Window, with as much ſhame and Ignominy as he there leans with Pride:</hi> then his Breath being ſtopt with the Flames, he gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>This Prophecy was fulfilled in a ſhort time after; for the people being generally diſcontented at the Cruelty uſed againſt Mr. <hi>Whiſchard;</hi> ſeveral perſons conſpired againſt him, and killed him in the Caſtle, and the Provoſt raiſing the Town, came to the Caſtle Gates, crying, <hi>What have you done with my Lord Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? where is he?</hi> To whom they anſwered from within, <hi>Return to your Houſes, for he hath received his reward, and will trouble the World no more.</hi> But they cryed, <hi>We will never depart till we ſee him.</hi> Then was he hanged out at that very window to ſatisfie them he was dead, and ſo the people departed.</p>
            <p>Shortly after one <hi>Adam Wallace</hi> was Burned likewiſe; and <hi>Henry Foreſt</hi> ſuffered the ſame Cruel Death, upon Account of Hereſie. One <hi>Walter Mill</hi> was accuſed for Hereſie, and being bid to recant, he ſaid, <hi>I am Corn and not Chaff, I will not recant the Truth;</hi> and being thereupon condemned to the Fire, and all things made ready to that purpoſe, they commanded him to go to the Stake; <hi>No,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>by the Laws of God I am forbidden to lay hands on my ſelf, therefore do you put me in the Fire, and you ſhall ſee my reſolution.</hi> Having then made his Prayer unto God, he ſpake thus to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>Although I have been a Great Sinner, yet it is not for that, but for Gods Truth contained in his Word of the Old and New Teſtament that I now ſuffer; and God out of his abundant Mercy doth honour me ſo far, as to make me
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107440:83"/> among other of his Servants to ſeal his Truth with my Blood; Dear Friends, as you would eſcape Eternal Death, be no more ſeduced with the Lyes of Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, Priors,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but truſt only in God:</hi> After he had thus ſpoke, he was tyed to the Stake, and the Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindled, he quietly ſlept in the Lord; and was the laſt perſon that dyed for the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year of our Lord 1641. there brake forth a moſt horrid and Bloody Rebellion and Maſſacre of the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> committed on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> a Nation famous for the Birth of divers worthy perſons therein, but none more renowned than that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, Learned and Religious Perſon <hi>James <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> late Lord Arch-biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland;</hi> who amongſt many other extraordinary Gifts and Graces which it pleaſed the Almighty to beſtow upon him, was wonderfully endued with a Spirit of Prophecy; from which among many other things he foretold this bloody Rebellion forty years before it came to paſs, in a Sermon which he preached at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> in the Year 1601. where from <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 4.6. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing concerning the Prophets bearing the Iniquity of <hi>Judah</hi> forty dayes, the Lord therein appointing a day for a Year, he made this direct application in relation to the Connivance at Popery at that time. <hi>From this Year,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will I reckon the ſin of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that thoſe whom you now embrace ſhall be your Ruin, and you ſhall bear your Iniquity:</hi> which Prediction proved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly true; for from that time 1601. to the Year 1641. was juſt forty years, in which it is notoriouſly known that the Rebellion and deſtruction of <hi>Ireland</hi> happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and which was acted by thoſe Popiſh Prieſts, Jeſuits and other Papiſts which were then connived at.</p>
            <p>For the Jeſuits, Prieſts and Friars were the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigators
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107440:83"/> to this horrid Maſſacre, by continual incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſtirring up the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Gentry and Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſhew the utmoſt of their Zeal therein, and this without any provocation given by the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> for it was obſerved, that they had all the Liberty they could reaſonably deſire, and that there was not any reaſon for ſuch Cruel Proceedings againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but only for that damnable and unpardonable ſin of being Proteſtants: And the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the deluded <hi>Papiſts</hi> to murther them, every where loudly declaimed, <hi>That they were Hereticks, and not fit to be ſuffered any longer amongſt them; that it was no more ſin to kill one of them, than to kill a Dog, and that it was a mortal and unpardonable ſin to relieve or protect any of them.</hi> And when their buſineſs was ſo fixt that they did not fear any miſcarriage, the ſucceſs of this <hi>Great Deſign</hi> was recommended in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers, as tending very much to the advancement of the <hi>Catholick cauſe;</hi> and they likewiſe maliciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the People the ſevere proceedings againſt the Papiſts in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things being in a readineſs, they proceeded to the Execution of this Damnable Contrivance; but their proceeding therein was various; ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> only ſtripping the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, and turning them out a Doors naked in the cold and ſnow, others cruelly Murdering man, woman and child, without the leaſt compaſſion; but they all reſolved upon this point, that by all manner of ways and means they would univerſally deſtroy and root the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Ireland:</hi> Nay the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſo inveterately malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt them, that they would not endure the very ſound of their Language, but puniſhed thoſe that ſpake <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the names of <hi>Engliſh</hi> places they changed into Old <hi>Iriſh.</hi> In ſome places they killed the Cows and Sheep, meerly becauſe they were <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:107440:84"/> and ſometimes they cut off their Legs, or a piece out of their Buttocks, and ſo left them to live in pain; and in other places thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cattel that they could not devour, they kill'd them, and left them in great multitudes ſtinking upon the Ground.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts gave the Sacrament to divers of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> upon Condition that they ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpare Man, Woman, nor Child of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, ſaying, <hi>That it did them a great deal of good to waſh their hands in their Blood.</hi> Some of their Prieſts Excommunicated all that ſhould from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth relieve or harbour any <hi>Engliſh, Scotch, or Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or give them Alms at their Doors, whereby many were Famiſhed to Death. Yea the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Monks and Fryers exhorted them with Tears not to ſpare the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but utterly to deſtroy them; nay they boaſted that when they had made an end of them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they would goe over into <hi>England,</hi> and would not leave the memorial of an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> under Heaven; and their Prieſts told them, <hi>it was as lawfull to kill an Engliſh man as to kill a Sheep or a Dog; and that it was no more Pity or Conſcience to take their Eſtates from them, than to take a Bone out of a Dogs mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day before this Horrid Maſſacre began, the Prieſts gave the people a diſmiſſion at Maſs, with full liberty to go out and take poſſeſſion of all their Lands, which they pretended were unjuſtly detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> although they were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forfeited by their repeated Rebellions and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the Government. They further told them, that they might lawfully ſtrip, rob, and deſpoil them of all their Goods and Chattels, <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants being</hi> (as they ſaid) <hi>worſe than Dogs, for they were Devils and worſhipped the Devil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Killing of ſuch was Meritorious, and an
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107440:84"/> Excellent Preſervative againſt the Pains of Purgatory; ſince the Bodies of ſuch Catholicks as ſhould dye in this Quarrel, would not be cold before their Souls ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up into Heaven; ſo that they need not fear the Pains of Purgatory:</hi> which occaſioned ſome of theſe Murdering Villains to Boaſt, after they had Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred many of the <hi>Engliſh, that if they ſhould dye preſently, they ſhould go ſtraight to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this Horrid Rebellion firſt began, ſeveral <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentlemen pretended great kindneſs to ſome of their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Neighbours, and perſwaded them to put their Goods and Cattel into their hands; ingaging that they would ſecure them from the rage of the Rabble; which made the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, becauſe of former familiarity, that they gave them Inventories of all they had; nay they digged up ſome of their beſt things which they had hidden in the Ground, and put it into their hands, whereby they got vaſt Quantities of Goods into their hands; And yet like <hi>True Papiſts</hi> they cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of it all; nay which was more Barbarous, they promiſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that if they would be contented to loſe their Goods, they and their Wives, and Children, ſhould peaceably depart the Country; and yet when they had got all they had, they inhumanely murthered them.</p>
            <p>In one place there were no leſs than Twenty two Widows, who were firſt Robbed, and then ſtript ſtark naked, and when in an Houſe they had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered themſelves with Straw, the Bloody <hi>Papiſts</hi> threw in burning Straw among them, on purpoſe to burn them together; And in a while after they broke forth into ſuch abominable Cruelties, Bloody Maſſacres and Murders, as would make the heart of any Chriſtian to ake, and his Ears to tingle at the Relation of them.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:107440:85"/>
            <p>In the Caſtle of <hi>Liſgol</hi> above an Hundred and Twenty Men, Women and Children were burnt together: Another Caſtle was delivered to one of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Commanders, upon Condition their lives ſhould be ſaved, but as ſoon as he entred he cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly murdered and deſtroyed them all without Mercy.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Portendown Bridge</hi> a thouſand Men, Women, and Children were drowned in the River; and it was teſtified upon Oath, that nine days after there was the Apparition of a man bolt upright in the water, Breaſt-high, with his hands lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that he was ſeen ſeveral times in that Poſture, from <hi>December</hi> to the end of <hi>Lent,</hi> at which time ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army paſſing that way, ſaw it likewiſe: after which it Vaniſhed away.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Elizabeth Price</hi> made Oath, that ſhe with other Women whoſe Huſbands and Children were drowned in that place, hearing of thoſe Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, went thither one Evening, at which time they ſaw a Woman riſe out of the River Breaſt-high, her hair hanging down, which was as white as Snow, and ſo was her ſkin, and that ſhe often cryed out, <hi>Revenge, Revenge, Revenge;</hi> which ſo affrighted them, that they went away.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Queens County,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> his wife, five Children and a Maid were all hanged together, and then cut down and put into a hole; the youngeſt Child though it was hanged, was not quite dead when it was put in, but put up its hand and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mammy, Mammy,</hi> and yet theſe Villains without Mercy buried it alive.</p>
            <p>They ſtripped a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi> and knocked him down for dead, but he afterwards recovering went into the Town naked, whereupon they hewed him
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107440:85"/> all to pieces: They alſo ript up his Wives Belly ſo that the Child dropped out: They likewiſe hanged up divers other Women with Child, and ripping them up, they gave their Infants to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by Dogs and Swine. In one place they ſet a Caſtle on fire wherein were many Proteſtants, and then rejoycingly ſaid among themſelves, <hi>Oh how ſweetly do they fry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one place they burnt two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles, and ſaid, it was Hell fire they burnt; they cut other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to pieces, and burnt them, threatning to do the like to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles: and in one place they took a Bible and laid it in a puddle of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then ſtamping on it, ſaid, <hi>A Plague on it, this Bible hath bred all the Quarrel.</hi> A Papiſt would have perſwaded a man and his wife to have joyned with them in the Maſſacre, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, <hi>That rather than they would forſake their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they would dye upon the Swords point;</hi> then they would have had the Woman burn her Bible, but ſhe told him, <hi>Rather than ſhe would burn her Bible, ſhe would dye the Death;</hi> whereupon they were both cruelly murdered.</p>
            <p>Theſe Barbarous Villains cauſed ſome Children to carry their Aged Parents to the River, and drown them: ſome Wives were forced to help to hang their Huſbands; in one Town they cauſed a young man to Murder his own Father, and then hanged him up; in another place they forced a Woman to kill her Huſband, and then cauſed her Son to kill his Mother, and then immediately hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Son: and their curſed malice was thereby ſhewn, that they might as much as in them lay, deſtroy Soul and Body together. Yea ſo deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was their Cruelty, that they taught <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to kill <hi>Engliſh</hi> Children, and two Boys boaſted
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107440:86"/> that they had at ſeveral times murthered and drowned thirty ſix <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women and Children; The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Women followed this Army of Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and provoked the men to Cruelty, crying out, <hi>Kill them all, ſpare neither Man, Woman, nor Child;</hi> and many of them ſtoned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women and their Children to Death; and cryed, <hi>Slay them all, the</hi> Engliſh <hi>are fit meat for Dogs, and their Children are Baſtards.</hi> Yea ſo Implacable was their malice, that one of them was very angry with her Huſband becauſe he did not bring the Greaſe of a Fat Gentlewoman whom they had ſlain, for them to make Candles of, which was commonly practiſed by them in other places.</p>
            <p>Yea they Boaſted that the day was their own, and that ere long they would not leave one <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Rogue living, but would utterly deſtroy every one that had but a drop of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood in him: yea they vowed, they would not leave one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beaſt alive, nor any of their breed.</p>
            <p>Alas! who can comprehend the Sighs, the Groans, the trembling and Aſtoniſhment of theſe poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Souls, to find themſelves ſo ſuddenly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and that without Remedy; What Shrieks, Cryes, and bitter Lamentations were there of Huſbands, Wives, Children, Servants and Friends, howling and weeping, finding themſelves without all hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from their preſent wofull Miſeries and Calamities.</p>
            <p>For by theſe and all manner of Cruelties and Barbarities which Hell it ſelf could invent, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts murdered and deſtroyed in a few Months near Three Hundred Thouſand Proteſtants, as it is commonly computed, without any manner of provocation, but only becauſe they were Proteſtants; whoſe deaths the Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107440:86"/> in a ſhort time after recompenſed upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the chief Murtherers, many thouſands periſhing by the Sword and the Plague that followed it, and the reſt without doubt, unleſs they heartily repent will receive the reward of their wickedneſs.</p>

            <head>The Cruelties, Plots, and Treaſons of the Papiſts againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with a brief account of the late Horrid Plot.</head>
            <p>AFter having briefly epitomized the bloody Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and ſlaughters of this Monſter of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Vaſſals, throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> let us now return home, and ſee if our own Countrey has eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped better than our Neighbours. Engliſhmen are generally accounted to be of a mercifull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and pitifull diſpoſition, apt to be touched with the miſeries of others, and are not in their own natures bloody, barbarous or Cruel; what then may be the cauſe of thoſe dreadfull marks of Rage and Fury that have been ſeen among us? How has this Fair Iſland been made an <hi>Acheldama,</hi> a Field of Skulls and Martyrs bones? All this we ſhall find pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from corrupt principles of Religion. <hi>I doubt not,</hi> (ſays a worthy Divine) <hi>but Papiſts are made like other men; nature hath not generally given them ſuch Savage and Cruel Diſpoſitions, but their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath made them ſo; I am loth to ſay it, and yet I am confident it is true, that many Papiſts would have been excellent Perſons and verie good men, if their Religion had not hindered them, if the Doctrines, and Principles of their Church had not ſpoiled their natural Diſpoſition. Good God! that any thing that is called Religion ſhould ſo preſently ſtrip men of all Humanity, and transform the mild and gentle Race of Mankind into Wolves and Tigers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Popery that alters the Nature of <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and makes them act like <hi>Turks, Infidels</hi> or <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians:</hi> its principles infect the Blood, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venome
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107440:88"/> the Soul; inſtead of being weak and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it makes them Proud and Arrogant; inſtead of performing the Commands of Chriſt, it makes men obey the Pope, though never ſo contrary to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If our Bleſſed Saviour ſays, <hi>Hurt no man, pray for your Perſecutors, ſubmit to Magiſtrates and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</hi> The Pope and his Doctrines ſay, <hi>Kill every man that is not of your Religion; Curſe thoſe that diſobey your Commands: Kill, Stab, or depoſe your Kings or Govenours.</hi> This is the Doctrine, and theſe are the Principles and Commands of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>It is ſome hundreds of years ſince this Bloody Beaſt of perſecution began to ſhew his Fangs and armed Claws in this Kingdom; and it was almoſt as ſoon perceived and teſtified againſt by ſome good men in thoſe times. For in the Year one Thouſand Two Hundred, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt the Corruptions and Superſtitions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and plainly diſcovered the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the burden of the Pope and his Ravenous Clergy; and after him <hi>John Groſtead</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> wrote to the Pope, and admoniſhed him, for which he had like to have loſt his life; yet the Pope did only hitherto ſhew his Teeth, and could not take his full ſwinge in Blood and Murther, which he afterward attained to.</p>
            <p>But ſince the Papiſts impertinently urge againſt us the Newneſs of our Religion, and that it was not known before <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> days, we ſhall produce much more early Teſtimonies againſt the Errors and abuſes in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church: For we find in the Year 884. <hi>John Patrick Erigena;</hi> a <hi>Britan,</hi> who was ordained the firſt Reader in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> was afterward Condemned, and Martyred by the Pope, for writing a Book
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107440:88"/> concerning the Sacrament. And in the year 960. many Miniſters and Divines wore the <hi>mark of the Beaſt</hi> in their faces, being by the Popes order Branded in the Faces with hot Irons, for Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many things about the <hi>Maſs, Purgatory, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery,</hi> and the like; and for ſaying, that <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that Cloiſters were the Nurſes of Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. In the year 1126. one <hi>Arnold</hi> and <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and a Preacher of the Goſpel, was Butchered at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for Preaching againſt the Pride of the Prelates, and the wicked lives of the Prieſts. In the Year 1160. the poor Perſecuted <hi>Waldenſes</hi> came hither for ſuccour, but inſtead thereof they were Perſecuted, Condemned, Burnt, Whipt, and ſtigmatiz'd for their Religion, both at <hi>Oxford</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>After which almoſt in every Year it pleaſed God to raiſe up ſeveral Learned and worthy men to teſtifie againſt the Horrid Corruptions of <hi>Rome,</hi> both by Speaking, Writing and Diſputing againſt them. As in the Year 1170. <hi>Gualo,</hi> and <hi>Gilbert Foliot, Doctors</hi> of Divinity, and after them <hi>Silveſter Gerald, Alexander</hi> a Divine, <hi>Gualter Maxes</hi> Arch Deacon of <hi>Oxford, Sebald</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York, William Stringham</hi> Doctor of Divinity, <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> Fellow of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, a Divine and Mathematician, <hi>John Scotus</hi> the Great <hi>Scotch-man;</hi> and about the ſame time Doctor <hi>John Wickliff, Jeoffery Chaucer, William Wickham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and many other Learned men.</p>
            <p>All theſe gave ample Teſtimonies by their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Writings againſt the many Corruptions, evil Doctrines and Superſtitious Worſhip of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, with the hazard of their Lives, Honours, Liberties, Eſtates and Fortunes; ſo that many were perſecuted, and ſome were burnt in the Reign of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107440:89"/> King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, 1174. and in the Year 1380. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tred Bolton,</hi> and <hi>John Aſhwerly</hi> endured Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and a while after <hi>John Aſhton, Walter Bruce, John Pateskul,</hi> and <hi>Doctor Crump,</hi> were perſecuted; and <hi>William Sawtree</hi> a Divine of <hi>Oxford</hi> was martyred, and <hi>William Swinderly</hi> was Burnt in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> In the Year 1407. <hi>William Thorp</hi> was Burnt, and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Redman</hi> and ſix others grievouſly perſecuted. In the Year 1417. the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was Burnt in St. <hi>Giles Fields: John Purey</hi> and <hi>Will. White,</hi> and <hi>Richard White</hi> were burnt. <hi>Peter Clark</hi> a Divine of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for maintaining publickly the Doctrine of <hi>Wicklif,</hi> was forced to fly, but was taken beyond Sea, his Tongue cut out, then hanged, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards burnt. <hi>Roger Ovely</hi> was hanged and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. In the Year 1447. <hi>Humfery</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was murdered by the Papiſts, for being a favourer of <hi>Wicklif,</hi> and other Preachers of the Truth; and divers others were many ways perſecuted for the ſake of Religion, before the riſing of <hi>Luther;</hi> God having in all Ages raiſed up ſome to Teſtifie to the Truth, and to maintain the purity of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And beſides theſe Divines, Learned and great men, there were ſeveral other good men of a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quality who openly owned the Truth, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſame; and as the number of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors grew greater, who now began to be called <hi>Lollards,</hi> ſo Perſecution grew hotter, and the Rage and Malice of the Papiſts increaſed. In the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, 1413. Sir <hi>Roger Acton, John Brown, John Beverly,</hi> and Thirty ſix more, were all put to Death in St. <hi>Giles Fields;</hi> and <hi>John Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Richard Turning, Benedict, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lman</hi> and ſeveral others were burnt, and many Impriſoned. In the Reign of <hi>King Henry</hi> the ſixt, <hi>William Tailor,</hi> one of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107440:89"/> 
               <hi>Wickliffs</hi> followers, was burnt in <hi>Smithfield: Henry Web, and Henry Florence,</hi> were Cruelly whipt, and about an hundred and twenty men and Women ſuffered perſecution, many of them were burnt. <hi>William White</hi> was Martyr'd; and at the ſame time two were burnt at <hi>Colcheſter; Richard Hoveden</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London</hi> was Martyr'd for the ſame cauſe near the Town, and ſeveral more ſeverely whipt and terribly handled; <hi>Thomas Baily</hi> and <hi>Richard Wiche</hi> both Miniſters were burnt; one in <hi>Smithfield</hi> and the other on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>John Gooſe</hi> was Burnt; and in <hi>H nry</hi> the ſevenths Regn, one <hi>Jean Boughton</hi> of Fourſcore years old was burnt in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk;</hi> another perſon was Burnt in <hi>Smithfield;</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were likewiſe ſtigmatized, and many did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. <hi>William Tilſworth</hi> was Burnt in the Town of <hi>Anaſham,</hi> where they forced his own Daughter to ſet fire to Faggots that were to Burn her Father; and two Years after <hi>Thomas Bernard,</hi> and <hi>John Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and one <hi>Roberts</hi> were Burnt in the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Buckingham. Thomas Chace</hi> after many Cruel Uſages and hardſhips was Murthered in Priſon. <hi>Thomas Norris:</hi> was burnt at <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Lawrence Gueſt</hi> at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and a Woman at <hi>Chipping Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> with ſeveral other perſons in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the Flames increaſed very much, and abundance Suffered in every place. In the Year 1511. <hi>Willam Sweeting</hi> and <hi>John B ewſter</hi> were burnt in <hi>Smithfield:</hi> the ſame year <hi>William Carder, Robert Harriſon,</hi> and <hi>Agnes Grebel</hi> were burnt, they forcing the Huſband and Daughter of the Woman to come in as Witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her: After this one Mr. <hi>Style</hi> with his Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and twenty five more were Burnt;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107440:90"/> five other Perſons were accuſed for reading an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Book, which contained many Damnable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and what ſhould this Book be, but only the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in Engliſh. In the Year 1514. <hi>Richard Hun</hi> was murdered in the <hi>Lollards Tower,</hi> and afterwards burnt; <hi>John Brown, John Stileman,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Man</hi> were burnt in <hi>Smithfield; Robert Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi> was Burnt at <hi>Buckingham, Chriſtopher Shoemaker</hi> at <hi>Newberry, Richard</hi> and <hi>Robert Bartlet,</hi> and <hi>John Scrivener</hi> were likewiſe burnt; and the Children of <hi>John Scrivener</hi> were forced to ſet fire to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; For it was uſual with them to compell Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to accuſe their Parents, and Parents their Children; Huſbands their Wives, and Wives their Huſbands; Intimate Friends, Brothers and Siſters to accuſe one another; and many Hundreds were likewiſe forced to recant and abjure againſt their Conſciencies, or elſe be Burnt.</p>
            <p>There were two things about this time that very much increaſed the profeſſors of the Goſpel in <hi>England;</hi> One was the appearance of <hi>Martin Luther</hi> in the World, who boldly owned the Truth, and loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Declaimed againſt the corruptions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church. Another thing was the Art of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which now began to be common, whereby the True Religion was the more eaſily promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and Diſperſed through every Countrey, and in all Languages.</p>
            <p>This Allarum'd the Pope and his Debauched Clergy, who were afraid to have their wicked Doctrines and Practices diſcovered to the people and thereupon they began to rage, and beſtir themſelves, raiſing Perſecution, and making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Slaughter in all places throughout the Kingdom againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as they were now called. In the Year 1519. ſeveral Proteſtans were
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107440:90"/> apprehended at <hi>Coventry,</hi> and impriſoned in filthy and naſty Dungeons, ſix of whom were afterwards burnt: <hi>Robbert Silkeb,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Harding</hi> were burnt ſhortly after. One <hi>Sigal Nicholſon</hi> a Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was hung up by the Privy-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for having <hi>Luther's</hi> Books in his Houſe: ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral likewiſe abjured; and the Body of <hi>William Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> Eſq; in <hi>Gloceſter-ſhire,</hi> becauſe he had left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Maſſes for his Soul, was taken out of the Grave and Burnt two Years after his Death. <hi>Richard Brafield</hi> a Monk of <hi>Bury,</hi> after he had been whipt and moſt Cruelly handled in Priſon, and Gagged, Beaten, and Bound, and Degraded after a very ſhamefull manner, was Burnt with much Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty in <hi>London,</hi> continuing half an Hour alive in the Flames for want of Wood; and when his left arm was burnt, he rubbed it with his right hand, and it fell down in the Fire; he continued in Prayer without moving to the laſt moment: ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were impriſoned, and fed with Bread made of Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt; ſome were ſet in the Stocks with Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaches on their Legs, and their hands ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled with Irons, that the Fleſh grew higher than the Irons, and with Iron Collars about their Necks: and many were Racked till they were Lamed. <hi>John Tewsbury, James Bainham, Valentine Sheafe</hi> and his Wife, <hi>John Bent,</hi> and one <hi>Trapnel,</hi> were all Burnt about the ſame time; three were hanged in Chains for Burning the Image or Rood of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Court. John Frith, Andrew Honor, Thomas Bennet, William Tindall, John Lambert, William Leiton</hi> and <hi>Collins</hi> a Lawyer, were burnt, and <hi>Robert Packington</hi> Murdered: Doctor <hi>Barns, Thomas Garret, William Hieron,</hi> were burnt in <hi>Smithfield, John Potter</hi> was murthered in Priſon: <hi>Robert Teſtwood, Anthony Parker</hi> and <hi>Henry Filmer,</hi> were burnt at <hi>Windſor.</hi> About five hundred
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107440:91"/> perſons in and about <hi>London</hi> either dyed in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or were burnt in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> In the Year 1541. <hi>Damlip, Dod, Sary,</hi> were Slain. One <hi>Henry</hi> at <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, Kerby</hi> and <hi>Clark</hi> at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> and <hi>Bury</hi> were burnt. In the Year 1546. Miſtris <hi>Ann Askew,</hi> one of the Ladies belonging to Queen <hi>Katherine Parr,</hi> becauſe ſhe would not confeſs any other Ladies, was put upon the Rack, and the Lord Chancellor himſelf being more Cruel, he acted then the Executioner, ordered her to be wracked to the utmoſt; ſhe was afterward Burnt in <hi>Smithfield;</hi> and at the ſame time and place were likewiſe Burnt <hi>Nicholas Belerrian</hi> a Miniſter in <hi>Shrop-ſhire, John Adams</hi> a Taylor, and <hi>John Lacels</hi> a Gentleman belonging to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; theſe beholding the Invincible Conſtancy and patience of Miſtriſs <hi>Askew,</hi> were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much incouraged in their Sufferings.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time Sir <hi>John Blage</hi> of the Kings Privy Chamber was falſly accuſed to have ſpoken againſt the Maſs, upon which he was condemned to be burnt in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> whereupon the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> begged his pardon of the King, who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to be drawn immediately. After his releaſe Sir <hi>George</hi> coming to the King, <hi>Ah my Pig,</hi> ſaid he, (for ſo he uſually called him;) <hi>Yea,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Blage) if your Majeſty had not been better to me than your Biſhops were, your Pig had been roaſted before this time.</hi> Preſently after <hi>Gardiner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> and his Confederates ſet forth a Cruel Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Kings Name, for aboliſhing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and all other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Books that diſcovered the truth to the people, and having obtained this, they very much rejoyced therein, hoping that they had now for ever ſuppreſſed the Goſpel, ſo that it ſhould never riſe again; and to ſtrike the greater terror into mens minds, they made a diligent ſearch after
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107440:91"/> the Profeſſors of the Truth, of whom they took the Names of ſome, drove away others, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by doubted not but to attain their ends. But it pleaſed God that in the midſt of theſe ſubtil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, for the deſtruction of his Goſpel and Servants, to take away King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in four Months after the Proclamation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all their hopes and projects were utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry the Eighth</hi> being dead, his only Son Prince <hi>Edward</hi> (our Engliſh <hi>Joſiah</hi>) aſcended the Throne, under whom the Proteſtant Religion was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and Popery and Superſtition aboliſhed; for he cauſed all Images to be demoliſhed, and as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous to be taken out of all Churches within his Dominions; the Learned men of his time he encouraged, and commanded them to open and expound the Scriptures, he aboliſhed the Maſs, and ordered the Service to be read in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Tongue, and the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be adminiſtred in both kinds to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>But it pleaſed God in a ſhort time to take him to himſelf: for in the Seventh Year of his Reign, and the ſeventeenth Year of his age, he was taken with a lingring ſickneſs; during which time a Marriage was concluded between the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudley</hi> eldeſt Son to the Duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereand,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whoſe mother being then alive was Daughter to <hi>Marry</hi> King <hi>Henry the Eighth's</hi> ſecond Siſter.</p>
            <p>The Marriage being finiſht, and the King every day more ſick than other, ſo that he ſeemed paſt Recovery, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> being ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to advance his Family, perſwaded the King
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107440:92"/> that the Church and the True Religion would be in great danger, if he did not chuſe a pious <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;</hi> and that it was the part of a good Prince to ſet aſide all other reſpects, when the Glory of God and the good of his Subjects were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>The King partly for his great deſire to have the Proteſtant Religion confirmed, and partly for the intire love which he bore to his Couſin the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> ſigned Letters Patents under the Broad Seal to appoint the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> to ſucceed him in the Kingdom, although her Title were excluded by the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> (who was alwaies a zealous Papiſt) and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> This was afterwards confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Nobility and Chief Lawyers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and was ſubſcribed to by all the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the Lord Maior and Aldermen of <hi>Lndon,</hi> who upon the Death of King <hi>Edward</hi> which happened in a ſhort time after, proclaimed the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> Queen in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Mary</hi> being in <hi>Hartford-ſhire,</hi> and hearing of it, preſently ſent to the Lords of the Council, commanding and requiring them to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim her Queen; which if they refuſed to do, ſhe threatned to recover her Right by force of Arms. The Lords returned anſwer, That the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> was inveſted, and poſſeſſed of the Crown by juſt Right and Title, both by the Ancient Laws of the Land, and by Letters Patents ſigned and ſealed by the late King before his death, and therefore they declared they would adhere to her and to none other, requeſting the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> that ſhe would not upon any pretence endeavour to diſturb the peace of the Kingdom, promiſing her that if ſhe would carry her ſelf as a dutifull Subject, they would be ready to do her any ſervice.</p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:107440:92"/>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Mary</hi> having received this anſwer, withdrew further from the City, and the Council being ſenſible of her ſtout and unquiet diſpoſition, they raiſed an Army, which was commanded by the Duke of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> The Lady <hi>Mary</hi> went into <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk</hi> gathering ſuch aid of the Commons as ſhe could, and kept her ſelf in <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham</hi> Caſtle, to whom the <hi>Suffolk</hi> men firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted, who being alwayes forward in promoting the Goſpel, promiſed her their aid and aſſiſtance, provided ſhe would make no alteration of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion as it was eſtabliſhed by her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Edward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this ſhe readily agreed, and confirmed it with ſuch Vows and Ptoteſtations that none could ſuſpect her; whereupon they joined with her: and thus by the help of the Proteſtants ſhe vanquiſhed the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and his Army, and was ſettled in the Kingdom; but ſhe ſoon forgot her promiſes, for theſe very <hi>Suffolk</hi> men obſerving that Popery would be re-eſtabliſhed, they Petitioned to her to perform her word to them; at which ſhe was extreamly diſpleaſed, and told them, <hi>Foraſmuch as you who are Members deſire to rule your Head, you ſhall one day find that Members muſt obey, not ſe k to rule;</hi> Yea one of the chief of theſe men, Mr. <hi>Dob</hi> by name, ſhe cauſed for the Terror of others to be ſet in the Pillory ſeveral times, and divers others that preſented Supplications to her not to ſet up Popery, ſhe cauſed to be ſent to priſon.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> being ſettled in the Kingdom, the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> her Father the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and her Huſband the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudley,</hi> were ſoon after Beheaded; and the Queen ſoon diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her diſaffection to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, by diſplacing all the Orthodox Biſhops, as <hi>Poinet, Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107440:93"/> Scorie, Hooper, Coverdale;</hi> and by releaſing out of the Tower <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> whom ſhe made Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> who was made Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> Then the Queen publiſht a Proclamation that ſhe was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to obſerve and maintain the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> wherein ſhe was bred up, requiring all her Subjects quietly to embrace the ſame.</p>
            <p>A while after this <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardiner</hi> begun a cruel and bloody perſecution upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and made them fall in heaps: For Mr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> all famous men, were condemned and burned for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. In the year 1555. <hi>Thomas Tomkins</hi> (whoſe hand B. <hi>Bonner</hi> burnt in priſon to try his conſtancy) was afterward burnt in <hi>Smithfield: William Hunter</hi> was cruelly handled and then burnt. Mr. <hi>Higbed</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cauſton</hi> were burnt in <hi>Eſſex: William Piggot, Stephen Knight,</hi> and <hi>John Lawrence</hi> were examined before Biſhop <hi>Bonner,</hi> and then burnt at ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Dr. <hi>Farrar</hi> Riſhop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> was burnt there; and <hi>Rawlins White</hi> was burnt at <hi>Cardiff, George Marsh</hi> at <hi>Cheſter, William Flower</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter, John Cardmaker</hi> a godly Miniſter in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and with him <hi>John Warn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time came a Letter from King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to Biſhop <hi>Bonner,</hi> that Hereticks were not proſecuted with ſuch ſeverity as they ought to be; which eaſily prevailed with <hi>Bonner,</hi> who was ready enough for Cruelty, and thereupon condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>John Symſon</hi> and <hi>John Ardeley</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who were burnt there: <hi>Thomas Hawks, Thomas Watts, Thomas Oſmund, William Bamford, Thomas Osburn,</hi> all of <hi>Cogſhall</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> being ſent up to <hi>Bonner,</hi> for not receiving the Sacrament at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> they were condemned and burnt in ſeveral places in <hi>Eſſex.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107440:93"/> John Bland, Nicholas Shetterden, Humfry Middleton, John Frankeſh,</hi> were al burnt: And a few days after, <hi>Nicholas Hall, Chriſtopher Wade, John Harpole,</hi> and <hi>Margery Boley,</hi> were burnt in <hi>Kent. Dirick Carver, John Launder, Thomas Iveſon, James Abbes, John Denley, John New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Patrick Packingham, Richard Hook</hi> and <hi>John Newman,</hi> were likewiſe burnt for Hereticks.</p>
            <p>The Priſons were now full in every place, and ſix men were condemned and burnt at <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and nothing but Cruelty and Oppreſſion was to be ſeen through the whole Land: Whereupon the Queens Commiſſioners for the more quick diſpatch took out ten of the Priſoners, whom they ſent to B. <hi>Bonner,</hi> and being examined by him about the Sacrament, they conſtantly adhering to the Truth, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and burnt in ſeveral places. <hi>Robert Samuel</hi> a Miniſter ſuffered Martyrdome at <hi>Norwich;</hi> two others at <hi>Ipſwich;</hi> five more in the Dioceſs of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi> the famous <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1556. their wicked and bloody rage ſtill continued, the Land was all in a Flame, and Blood and Cruelty reigned in every place: For there were ſeven burnt in <hi>Smithfield</hi> in one fire; four more in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cranmer</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was burnt in <hi>Oxford.</hi> And, to conclude, though the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was the ſhorteſt of any Prince ſince the Conqueſt, except King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, yet in her days there was more Chriſtian blood ſpilt for Religion, than in any Kings Reign whatſoever, ſince <hi>Lucius</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Chriſtianity in this Land; for in the five years of her Reign, there periſhed in the conſuming Flames, for the Profeſſion of the Proteſtant Religion, no leſs than two Hundred ſeventy ſeven Perſons, of all Ages and both Sexes: there ſuffered five Biſhops
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107440:94"/> and Archbiſhops, twenty one Divines, eight Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, four Tradeſmen, an hundred Husbandmen, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Labourers, twenty ſix Wives, twenty Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Virgins, two Boys, and two Infants; one in the Iſle of <hi>Guernſey,</hi> who ſpringing out of his Mothers Womb as ſhe was burning at the Stake, was moſt inhumanely thrown in again and burnt for a young Heretick. And beſides theſe, there were ſixty four perſecuted for their Religion, whereof ſeven were whipt, ſixteen periſhed in Priſon, twelve were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Dunghills, and many more lay condemned, but were ſaved by the Death of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Succeſſion of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> put ſome ſtop to the cruel rage of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> for the Power and Authority of the Pope vaniſhed, and Peace, Reſt and Liberty for all the good People of the Nation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> out of their extream Loyalty to the Pope, thought it a ſin to live peaceably under an Heretical Prince: Eſpecially when two Popes had thundred out Excommunications againſt her, curſing her, and freeing her Subjects from their Allegiance towards her, and threatning them under danger of the Wrath of God, not to aſſiſt her, but to imploy all their Power to bring her to condign puniſhment, and promiſing rewards to all perſons who ſhould lay hands upon this proſcribed Woman, which was to be payd out of the Treaſury of the Church, together with a full pardon of all their ſins who ſhould engage againſt her.</p>
            <p>But when the Pope and his Accomplices ſaw, that all this would not effect their deſires, the Queens Subjects being too faithfull to engage in any ſuch villanous deſigns; they then proceed to ſecret Plots and Attempts againſt her: As that wherein the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Robert Biddulph</hi> were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107440:94"/> in the year 1566. and for which <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Suffered at <hi>York,</hi> and after that <hi>Leonard Davis</hi> deſigned miſchiefs againſt her with the like ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. In the year 1578. the Invaſion of <hi>Ireland</hi> at the great charges of the Pope, was happily prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The next year <hi>James Fitz-morris</hi> is ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> with <hi>Saunders,</hi> who carryed conſecrated Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to them. The next year after <hi>San Joſeph</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſent thither with ſeven hundred <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Souldiers, and the Popes promiſe of ten hundred thouſand Crowns, to carry on the work of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; and to them joined the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> and his Brothers; but they were all happily defeated.</p>
            <p>But theſe projects likewiſe failing, they conſpire the death of the Queen, and make ſeveral Attempts to murther her; firſt by one <hi>Somervile</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> Prieſts; and one of them being condemned was found ſecretly murdered, for fear he ſhould diſcover others. After this followed the practices of <hi>Mendoza</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambaſſador here, with <hi>Throgmorton</hi> and <hi>Parry,</hi> who had Letters of plenary Indulgence, Pardon, and remiſſion of all their ſins ſent them by the Pope, for killing the Queen; And the ſame year, <hi>Savage</hi> made the like Vow to murder the Queen, being inſtigated thereto by <hi>Gifford</hi> and <hi>Hodgſon</hi> two Popiſh Prieſts.</p>
            <p>A while after <hi>Babington</hi> upon the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples engaged to commit the like wicked act, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of one <hi>Ballard</hi> a Jeſuit, but being happily diſcovered, divers of them were condemned, and juſtly executed for the ſame, and were regiſtered for Saints and Martyrs in the <hi>Romish</hi> Calender. Yet by the means of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador out <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Moody</hi> were dealt withal to commit the like Villany, <hi>Moody</hi> propoſing to lay a bag of Gun-powder under the Queens Bed-Chamber.</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:107440:95"/>
            <p>But this like the reſt being happily prevented, the Pope ſtirs up his Dear Son, <hi>Philip the Second</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> openly to invade <hi>England,</hi> which he did in the year 1588. who though in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> time, he pretended great kindneſs to the Queen, yet now in hopes of gaining <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which the Pope had beſtowed upon him, he comes to take poſſeſſion thereof, with a vaſt and (as the Pope Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened it) <hi>Invincible Armada,</hi> conſiſting of an hundred and thirty tall Ships, extraordinary well furniſhed, and containing fifty ſeven Thouſand eight hundred and eight Tun, wherein were Eight Thouſand ſix hundred Seamen, Twenty Thouſand Souldiers, two Thouſand Gally Slaves; beſides Gentlemen and Voluntiers in abundance, ſo that there was ſcarce a Family in <hi>Spain,</hi> who had not either a Son, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Cozen in the Fleet.</p>
            <p>There were likewiſe aboard them two thouſand ſix hundred and thirty great Ordnance, with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Bullets, Match, Muſkets, Pikes, Spears, Swords, and all things proportionable, with Knives, Daggers, Skeins, Chains and Whips, to Torment and cut the Throats of the poor <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants;</hi> and with them came ſwarms of thoſe Locuſts called <hi>Capuchins, Mendicants, Jeſuits,</hi> and other Officers of the <hi>Sacred Order</hi> of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> as they prophanely call it.</p>
            <p>And beſides all this, there lay in <hi>Flanders,</hi> fifty thouſand old Souldiers, and two hundred eighty eight Veſſels, ready to tranſport them, under the command of the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> all the King of <hi>Spains</hi> beſt Souldiers, even as far as <hi>America,</hi> being drawn forth for this <hi>Holy War:</hi> The whole of this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition having coſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> twelve Millions of Crowns before their ſetting forth; the Pope like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe contributing a Million of Gold to ſo pious a deſign. But the goodneſs and mercy of God at that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107440:95"/> time defended <hi>England</hi> from the gaping Jaws of deſtruction, and diſcomfited this Mighty <hi>Armada</hi> and all its mighty preparations, and ſent them home full of ſhame, loſs and confuſion; ſo that of one hundred thirty four Ships that ſet ſail out of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> only thirty three returned: the <hi>Spaniard</hi> loſing in this Voyage Eighty one Ships, and above thirteen thouſand five hundred Souldiers, and two thouſand more taken Priſoners in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> the reſt of the Navy being loſt and deſtroyed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the Seas, Rocks, Sands and Tempeſts, all ſeeming to conſpire to the defeating of this proud and Inſolent attempt.</p>
            <p>But theſe ſort of People will never take notice of Gods Judgments upon their wicked deſigns and Enterprizes, and notwithſtanding all this, they ſhut their Eyes and will not ſee that God is againſt them; for they no ſooner recover breath, but they ſend over new Commiſſions, and more curſed Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries diſguiſed in all ſhapes into <hi>England,</hi> with new Plots, Contrivances and deſigns; <hi>Lopez</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, <hi>Cullen, York, Williams, Squire</hi> and <hi>Hesket,</hi> all enter into a Conſpiracy to kill the Queen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtantly encouraged by the Jeſuits and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters of State. And theſe proving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive, in the year 1599. the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> is ſtirred up to make a new Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame Pardons and Indulgences ſent them, as is uſually given by the Popes to thoſe that go to fight againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> And in the year 1601. the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſends a great Fleet of Soldiers to <hi>Kinſale</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the aſſiſtance of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. But notwithſtanding all theſe wicked and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable deſigns, this glorious and Heroick Queen of bleſſed memory, having outlived four Kings and Eight Popes, dyed in Peace, and left her flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107440:96"/> Kingdoms to her Succeſſor King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Papiſts being thus diſappointed of their great hopes and expectations, by the ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Proteſtant King to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby uniting into one Body <hi>Scotland, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> one would have Imagined that all their contrivances would have been daſht, ſince they could not well think that ſo long and well ſettled a Reformation in Church and State, could very eaſily be broken and confounded; yet ſtill they give not over, but encourage one another in their wickedneſs, and the Pope ſent over two Bulls to deprive King <hi>James</hi> of the Crown, and ſought to raiſe diviſions and diſſentions amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But God continuing to fruſtrate all their deſigns, they now grew as it were deſperate and entred upon the moſt barbarous and Helliſh Plot and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance that ever was hatched in the Brains or Hearts of men, which is that which we call the <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon,</hi> and which we yearly comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate upon the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> they deſigning to act it on that day in the year 1605.</p>
            <p>This horrid deſign was contrived by divers Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, Prieſts, and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts, who by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the Parliament-Houſe, and planting there Thirty ſix Barrels of Gunpowder, intended by firing the ſame when both Houſes were ſitting, to have blown up and deſtroyed not only the King as the Head of the Kingdom, but with him his Queen, the Prince, and all the Royal Iſſue, together with the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, Nobility and the chief of the Gentry of the whole Kingdom; all ſhould have periſhed together at one Blow, and have become a Sacrifice to the enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Luſts of theſe Bloody minded Papiſts. A Plot and Villany that no Age can paralel, no Country ever could produce the like, and which was as mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107440:96"/> prevented and detected, as if it were by the immediate finger of God, who diſcovered their treaſonable practices, even within their dark Vaults and Cellars, when the very Train was laid, and fire almoſt put to it: and in this horrid Conſpiracy <hi>Catesby, Piercy, Faux, Digby, Garnet, Hall,</hi> &amp;c. all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts, were conſiderable Actors and Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all ſworn to ſecreſie, with Horrid Oaths and Imprecations, taking the Holy Sacrament and engaging themſelves one to another thereby, and by their Faith in the Holy Trinity, never to ſhrink from the Execution of this their Helliſh Intention, till they had performed the ſame: They were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe promiſed from abroad Ships and men, and ten hundred thouſand Crowns to carry on their work.</p>
            <p>And though this horrid Conſpiracy has been ſufficiently diſcovered and made plain, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſome of the Conſpirators who were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and by writings under their own hands; yet according to their uſual Impudence, which they learned of their predeceſſor <hi>Nero,</hi> (who when he had ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on Fire, charged it upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) the Papiſts intended to have laid that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Act upon the <hi>Puritans;</hi> and ſince this they have endeavoured to make the world believe that it was a Contrivance of King <hi>James,</hi> thereby endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring ſince they could not blow up the King with Gunpowder, to blaſt his good Name, and to make him odious to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>But three Kingdoms are not ſo eaſie to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, neither are we ſo horridly impious, to mock God ſo ſolemnly with yearly Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings; neither need we think it ſo ſtrange, ſince Lyes and Impudence are the grand ſupporters of the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom, without which ſuch a medley of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107440:97"/> Nonſence and Foolery would be hooted out of the world.</p>
            <p>And from that time to this very day, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have been and are the Grand Diſturbers of theſe Nations: and it is ſufficiently manifeſted that they had no ſmall hand in our late Troubles, ſince which they have continually ſought the ruin and deſtruction of all Proteſtants, by all manner of curſed ways and methods imaginable.</p>
            <p>In the year 1666. <hi>Sept.</hi> 2. about two a Clock in the morning, there began a ſad and lamentable Fire in a Bakers Houſe in <hi>Pudding Lane</hi> near <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet-hill, London,</hi> which raged with extream Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, being accompanied with a ſtrong North-eaſt wind, ſo that deſpiſing all means uſed for its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing, it ſpread far and near, ſometimes with and ſometimes againſt the wind, and ſo continued for the ſpace of neer four days, till it had burnt down thirteen thouſand two hundred houſes, which ſtood upon three hundred thirty ſeven Acres of Ground within the Walls, and ſixty three Acres three Roods without; beſides eighty nine Pariſh Churches, the moſt ſpacious Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> the <hi>Great Guild-hall,</hi> the <hi>Cuſtom Houſe,</hi> Many magnificent Halls of Companies, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principal City Gates, and other publick Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which was accompanied with the loſs of vaſt quantities of rich Houſehold-ſtuff, and Goods of all ſorts, but eſpecially four or five; that is, Books, of which alone were loſt near the value of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand pound; Tobacco, Sugar, Wines, and Plumbs, being heavy goods: So that the whole loſs is computed by an Ingenious Perſon to be Nine Millions and nine hundred thouſand pounds, and yet not above ſix or eight perſons through Gods Providence were burnt in this vaſt deſolation.</p>
            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:107440:97"/>
            <p>Upon the Eighteenth of <hi>September</hi> the Parliament met, and the Commons appointed a Committee to examine into the Cauſes of the fire, and to take Informations concerning it; and in a ſhort time ſo many and ſuch very conſiderable Informations were brought in, that it was no longer doubtfull but the Papiſts were the Contrivers and Managers of this dreadful Fire.</p>
            <p>For among other things it plainly appeared, that divers of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party were made acquainted with it before it happened: for Mr. <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff</hi> depoſed, That being in diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Richard Langhorn</hi> (ſince Executed for High Treaſon) in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> before the Fire, concerning Religion, <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> took him by the hand and ſaid to him, <hi>You expect great things in ſixty ſix, and think that</hi> Rome <hi>will be deſtroy'd, but what if it be</hi> London?</p>
            <p>A <hi>French</hi> man told one <hi>Elizabeth Styles,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> before the fire, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maids would love the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> better when there was not an houſe left ſtanding between <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> and <hi>London-Bride:</hi> to which ſhe replyed, <hi>She hopes his eyes would never ſee that:</hi> he ſaid, <hi>This will happen betwixt</hi> June <hi>&amp;</hi> October.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> in his Narrative, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. ſays, That in <hi>July</hi> 1678. being in diſcourſe with one <hi>Strange</hi> a Jeſuit, <hi>Strange</hi> told him that they had got fourteen thouſand pound by the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> in 1666. and that they ſpent ſeven hundred fireballs to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their Villany; and that when the Fire-Merchants were at work, then other Papiſts both men and women were imployed by them to plunder what they could; that they had a Warehouſe in <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> where ſome of their ſtollen Goods were laid, and other Goods they concealed in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> as Hollands, Cambricks, Fine Cloth, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantities of Plate, and a Box of Jewels.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107440:98"/> Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> aſked <hi>Strange,</hi> How the King came to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape (for it ſeems his death was deſigned then?) <hi>Strange</hi> replyed, <hi>Indeed they were reſolved to have cut him off, but ſeeing him ſo Induſtrious about Quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fire, they could not find in their hearts to do it; Strange</hi> ſaid, there were about Fourſcore and ſix em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in it; and <hi>John Grove</hi> ſince Executed for high Treaſon, told Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> that he fired <hi>Southwark,</hi> and that the Society of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> got two thouſand pound by that Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Hubert</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Papiſt of <hi>Normandy</hi> began this Fire in <hi>London,</hi> being Hired thereto by <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Peidelow</hi> likewiſe a papiſt; and <hi>Hubert</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ruin and deſolation that followed, could not be quiet till he had freely diſcovered the whole matter; Affirming that by <hi>Peidelows</hi> directions he put a Fire-ball to the end of a long pole, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with a piece of Match put it into the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers window, and ſtayed till the houſe was in a Flame. A <hi>French</hi> Merchant went to <hi>Hubert</hi> in the <hi>White Lyon</hi> Priſon in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and told him, <hi>He did not believe him Guilty of what he had confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Hubert</hi> replyed, <hi>Yes Sir, I am guilty of it, and have been brought to it by the inſtigation of</hi> Mr. Peidelow, <hi>but not out of any malice to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from a deſire of reward which he promiſed me upon my return into</hi> France. A while after <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was Tryed and Executed for this horrid Fact, owning and acknowledging to the laſt his doing thereof, by the Inſtigation of <hi>Piedelow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this not doing their work, they took divers other methods for carrying on their deſigns, which they had very near brought to perfection in the year 1678. had not the Divine Providence moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of Dr. <hi>Titus Oats</hi> in the diſcovery thereof; who notwithſtanding the reproaches of his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107440:98"/> Popiſh adverſaries, was liberally Educated in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he took his Degree, and afterward proceeded Doctor in Divinity at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanca</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> no contemptible Univerſity. In the year 1672. he was Vicar of <hi>Bobbing</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> but the Air not agreeing with him, he left it; and was for ſome time Miniſter near <hi>Chicheſter</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and afterwards came to be Chaplain to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> with an ample teſtimony of his ſober Life and Converſation; and whilſt he was there, he overheard ſome whiſperings among the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts, (who were very converſant in that Family) that there was ſome <hi>Great Deſign</hi> in hand, but could not learn the particulars. He had heard from his Proteſtant Friends, and had read in Sir <hi>Hamond L'Stranges</hi> Hiſtory of King <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> and other Judicious Authors, That the Papiſts had for many years carried on a deſign to Introduce Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery once more into theſe Kingdoms; which made him deſire to know the bottom thereof, and if it were poſſible to prevent it: To this end, he more freely converſed with that Party than he formerly uſed to do, and ſeemed diſſatisfied in ſome things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Church, and deſired to diſcourſe with ſome <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are accounted the moſt learned Men of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> faction.</p>
            <p>This upon ſome Cautions he obtained, and after divers Conferences with them (in which he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to be overcome,) he was formally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and a while after ſeeming to aſpire to a higher degree of Perfection, he deſired to be admired into the Order of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> which after three dayes conſideration they conſented to; and becauſe he was a man of years, being about Twenty eight, they would not imploy him as a Novice, but made him a Meſſenger of the Society.</p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:107440:99"/>
            <p>This being the mark he aimed at, they ſent him with Letters to <hi>Valedolid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> which he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to contain ſomething of their Helliſh contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, dexterouſly opened by the way, and thereby made ſome diſcovery of their wicked Intentions; however he managed their Affairs with ſo much ſatisfaction, that in a ſhort time they made him privy to their moſt ſecret Conſultations, and keeping ſhort Notes of all things of Concernment, he was thereby in a capacity to give an account of ſo many ſeveral particulars as he has diſcovered; which have had the happineſs to be confirmed by other Circumſtances and Evidence, and have not the leaſt contradicted one another, nor thoſe other Papers which have been found elſewhere, nor differed from the Informations that have been given in by Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mowbray,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baldron,</hi> and others, whom God hath ſince raiſed up, further to clear and unmaſk this deteſtable and bloody Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> was reſolved as much as in him lay to prevent their Traiterous deſigns upon his Majeſties Life, though he endangered his own thereby, ſince he obſerved that all their Contrivances were ripe, and there only wanted the <hi>Fatal Blow</hi> to deſtroy the life of his Sacred Majeſty, and the Religion, and Liberties of theſe three Kingdoms; And whereas Father <hi>Whitebread</hi> the <hi>Provincial</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> had engaged Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> (before his laſt return into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) to aſſaſſinate and murder <hi>Iſrael Tongue</hi> Doctor of Divinity, becauſe he had tranſlated a Book In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>The Jeſuits Morals,</hi> and had promiſed him Fifty pound as a reward for the ſame, Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> after his coming over became acquainted with Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> and finding him to be a perſon of Truſt and Integrity, he gave him an Account of his Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107440:99"/> and likewiſe ſome Heads of the Plot in General. After which they both ſeriouſly Conſulted together of the beſt methods for making this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Diſcovery; ſince they were ſure to meet with great oppoſition therein.</p>
            <p>At laſt they concluded to acquaint Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Kirby</hi> therewith, as a perſon whom for his Loyalty Courage, and zeal for the Safety of his Majeſties Perſon, and the Proteſtant Religion, they judged very fit and capable to aſſiſt them; and therefore on <hi>Monday, Auguſt</hi> 12. 1678. Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> ſhewed Mr. <hi>Kirby</hi> Forty three Articles drawn up in writing, deſiring him that without making any other Perſon acquainted therewith, he would diſcover the ſame to the King: And Mr. <hi>Kirby</hi> very generouſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the ſame, and accordingly the next morning in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, he humbly acquainted his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, <hi>That his Enemies had a Deſign againſt his Life, and humbly beſeeched his Majeſty to uſe all Caution, for he did not know but he might be in danger in that very walk.</hi> But his Majeſty armed with his Native goodneſs and Innocency, ſeemed more ſurprized with the Strangeneſs of the News, than with the apprehenſion of the danger, and only aſked, <hi>How that could be?</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Kirby</hi> replyed, <hi>That it might be, by being ſhot at:</hi> And gave a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that there were two men, <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> by name, that watched an opportunity to ſhoot his Majeſty, and that another Perſon was hired to Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon him.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty ordered further Scrutiny ſhould be made into the buſineſs; and a while after Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> having written fair Copies of his Informations, upon the 28. of <hi>September,</hi> 1678. went to Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey,</hi> and made Oath of the truth and reality thereof; Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi> deſiring to keep a Copy of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107440:100"/> the Informations himſelf, as having never before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed them, which it may be was the occaſion of his horrid Murther, which ſoon after followed.</p>
            <p>The Plot in General ſeemed to be by Fire and Sword to ſubvert and deſtroy the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eſtabliſhed Government of theſe three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and to reduce them to <hi>Popery:</hi> The chief Conſpirators being <hi>Innocent</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> now Pope, who in <hi>The Congregation for propagating the Faith,</hi> held about <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1677. and conſiſting of about 350.

               <hi>Mounſieur le Cheſe,</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> Confeſſor to the <hi>French</hi> King, was likewiſe concerned; with whom <hi>Edward Coleman</hi> held correſpondence; Alſo <hi>Strange</hi> and <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi> Provincials of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and the <hi>Benedictine Monks</hi> of the <hi>Savoy</hi> were in this curſed Conſpiracy, and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Seminary Prieſts,</hi> of whom there were at that time in <hi>England</hi> about Eighteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
            <p>Divers Lay Perſons of Quality were drawn in, who were to command Forces, and to execute the Great Offices of the Realm; as the Lord <hi>Arundel of Warder</hi> was appointed Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> Lord <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> Sir <hi>William Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:107440:100"/> Lord <hi>Privy Seal, Edward Coleman</hi> Secretary of State; and for the Military part, Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> to be Lord General, Lord <hi>Peters</hi> Lieutenant General, Sir <hi>Francis Ratcliff</hi> Major General, <hi>John Lambert</hi> Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant General, <hi>Richard Langhorn</hi> Advocate General, who had Commiſſions ſent them from <hi>Paulus de Oliva,</hi> and directed from <hi>Rome</hi> to Mr. <hi>Langhorn.</hi> This was ſo great and glorious a work, that the chiefeſt of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy through <hi>Europe</hi> were engaged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; ſo that it cannot be ſaid to be the Act or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of any few particular Perſons, but <hi>The una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous undertaking of their whole Church,</hi> and ſo to their everlaſting Infamy ought to be Recorded.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Means whereby this was to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, the firſt and chief was, By Murdering his Sacred Majeſty, which was to be accompliſht either by Piſtolling of him, wherein <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> were ingaged; or by Stabbing, and this to be done by <hi>Conyers</hi> and <hi>Anderton, Benedictine Monks,</hi> or four <hi>Iriſh Ruffians.</hi> Or laſtly by Poyſoning, for which Money was payd to the Undertaker.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another means was by firing <hi>London, Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and the parts adjacent, and likewiſe other Cities and great Towns in <hi>England,</hi> immediately upon the Murder of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By a General Maſſacre, to which purpoſe they had deſigned to raiſe an Army, which was to conſiſt of Fifty Thouſand men, to be Liſted in and about <hi>London:</hi> The Officers to be all Reſolute Papiſts, and for the moſt part <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and theſe they gave out were enough to cut the Throats of One Hundred Thouſand Proteſtants, eſpecially being taken upon a Surprize, when the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was undiſciplined and unprovided. Care was taken like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe about ſecuring <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <pb n="200" facs="tcp:107440:101"/>
            <p>Great sums of Money were provided for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary charge of this mighty undertaking, and it was diſcourſed, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>England</hi> had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great Eſtate <hi>per Annum</hi> for that purpoſe; and that they had a great Stock in ready Money; and were to receive Eleven thouſand Crowns from <hi>Rome,</hi> Ten thouſand pound from <hi>Spain,</hi> and Ten thouſand from <hi>France,</hi> beſides ſeveral other very conſiderable ſumms, for promoting this vaſt deſign. And this is a brief Abſtract of this bloody and Helliſh <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot, abundance of other particulars being omitted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears that this <hi>Horrid Plot</hi> is hardly to be parallel'd in any Hiſtory, conſidering that without any provocation ſo many Thouſand Proteſtants were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ſlaughter, deſtruction and Murder, only to advance and promote the Holy Catholick Religion, as they falſly call that Chaos of Blaſphemy and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
            <p>Preſently after this Remarkable diſcovery, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the murther of that worthy Magiſtrate Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfry;</hi> who as is before related, having taken the Depoſitions of Doctor <hi>Oats,</hi> which was no more than any Juſtice of Peace by Virtue of his Office was bound to do; yet it ſo enraged the Conſpirators, that they reſolved to cut him off, to deterr (as may be ſuppoſed) all other Magiſtrates from intermedling with any Affairs relating to the Plot.</p>
            <p>But it pleaſed God that the Crafty were taken in their own ſnare, and they Mortally wounded their own cauſe; for this bloody Enterprize allarum'd the whole Kingdom, and left no doubt whether there were a Plot or no. It is not certainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered how many there were in all, who conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Death; but thoſe that are known, are Father <hi>Kelly</hi> and Father <hi>Girald,</hi> two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107440:101"/> 
               <hi>Robert Green</hi> Cuſhion-man to the Queens Chappel, <hi>Lawrence Hill</hi> Servant to Dr. <hi>Godden</hi> Treaſurer of the Chappel, <hi>Henry Berry</hi> who was Porter of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſethouſe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Miles Prance</hi> a Goldſmith in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden;</hi> theſe were actually preſent at the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; two other ſhould have been there, but were not; that is, Father <hi>Lewſon</hi> a Prieſt, and one <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Vernatti,</hi> who are ſince fled. There were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party to have done it, but did not, namely, <hi>Pritchard, Le Fair, Welch, Keins,</hi> all Jeſuits, and Mr. <hi>William Bedlow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of thoſe that effected the Villany, 'tis Judged that <hi>Vernatti,</hi> and ſome other Popiſh Prieſts under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it, and that they drew in <hi>Green, Hill,</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> firſt, and afterwards ingaged Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, That Sir <hi>Edmundbury was a bitter Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of Catholicks, and a particular Enemy to her Majeſties Servants,</hi> (whereof Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> reckoned himſelf one:) <hi>And that he had lately examined Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt them, and had got Depoſitions to fix baſe Crimes and Scandals on their Religion, and that the Catholicks would be ruined, unleſs he were taken off; and therefore it was neceſſary for the Glory of God, and good of the Church, that it ſhould be effected; and that there ſhould be a good reward given them for it:</hi> And when Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſcrupled it, the two Prieſts, <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> told him, <hi>It was no ſin, but a work of Charity, and ſo far from being a Murther, that it was a Meritorious work, and he ought to aſſiſt in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus reſolved of his Death, they conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral times how to effect it; but at laſt, upon <hi>Saturday, October</hi> 12. 1678. <hi>Hill</hi> went to Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfry</hi>'s houſe in the Morning, but what he ſaid to him is not known, and then taking his leave, went to <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> and ſtaid with them hard
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107440:102"/> by, waiting Sir <hi>Edmundburys</hi> going forth, which was about Ten or Eleven a Clock, they dogged him up and down all day, till about ſeven a Clock in the Evening, and then <hi>Green</hi> came to <hi>Prances</hi> houſe, and told him that they had ſet him, but did not name where, only near St. <hi>Clements,</hi> and that <hi>Prance</hi> muſt haſten down to the <hi>Water-Gate</hi> at <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> where he ſhould find <hi>Kelly</hi> and <hi>Berry;</hi> which he did, and they three waited there till about Nine a Clock at night, then <hi>Hill</hi> came in haſt and told them he was coming, and that they muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Quarrel, and he would fetch him in; <hi>Kelly</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> began a ſeeming Quarrel, and juſt as Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi> was paſſing by the <hi>Gate, Hill</hi> who was acquainted with him, ſteps out in a great deal of haſte, and intreated him, <hi>For Gods ſake to come in, for there were two men a Quarelling, and he was afraid there would be blood ſhed:</hi> He refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at firſt, but the other being importunate, he conſented, and <hi>Hill</hi> entred the Gate firſt, after him Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> and <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> followed juſt behind. As ſoon as they were in, <hi>Prance</hi> watched at the <hi>Water-Gate</hi> that no body came that way, <hi>Berry</hi> was to ſecure the Stairs and paſſage by the Chappel, but firſt he and <hi>Kelly</hi> who pretended to Quarrel, ſtood at the end of the rail by the Queens Stables, and as Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> went down toward them, <hi>Green</hi> ſuddenly threw a twiſted Handkerchief, or Cravat about his neck, and preſently all four pull'd him down, and throt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, ſo as he could make no noiſe, then they threw him behind the Rail, and gave him many Violent punches on the breaſt with their Knees, and <hi>Green</hi> with all his force wrung his Neck almoſt round.</p>
            <p>Having committed this Horrid Murther, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107440:102"/> the body into Dr. <hi>Goddins</hi> Lodgings, and on Monday to another Room, on Tueſday from thence to another, but on Wedneſday night about twelve a Clock they carried his body towards <hi>Hamſtead,</hi> about two miles out of Town, and laid it at a place called <hi>Primroſe-Hill, Girald</hi> having run Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi>'s own Sword through him, and left it in, and the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard and Gloves they layd at a ſmall diſtance from him, that it might be ſuppoſed he had murdered himſelf.</p>
            <p>The death of this worthy Gentleman cauſed great Conſternation among the People, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to publiſh a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion promiſing 500. l. to the Diſcoverer. And a while after Mr. <hi>William Bedlow,</hi> came in, and gave ſome Account of the Murder, and likewiſe of the Plot in General; and upon the 21. of <hi>December</hi> being in the Lobby of the Houſe of Commons, he there ſaw Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> whom he knew to be concerned, they two having Viewed Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi>'s dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy together at <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> and charging Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> with the Murther, he was thereupon committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and a while after confeſſed the whole matter as is before related.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, <hi>Green, Hill</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> were ſeized, and upon full Evidence condemned, and executed, <hi>Kelly</hi> and <hi>Girald</hi> fled; there were likewiſe ſeveral Traitors tryed and Executed for the Horrid Plot; that is, <hi>Edward Coleman, William Ireland, Tomas Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering, John Grove, Thomas Whitebread, William Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, John Fenwick, John Gaven, Anthony Turner,</hi> and <hi>Richard Langhorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Papiſts being ſtill diſappointed in their curſed contrivances, yet reſolved not wholly to deſiſt, but endeavoured to ſtifle the Evidence by promiſing them great rewards and encouragements not to diſcover the whole of what they knew, or to deny what
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107440:103"/> they had depoſed; and upon this account Mr. <hi>Reding</hi> tampered with Mr. <hi>Bedlow;</hi> Mris. <hi>Price</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tasborough</hi> endeavoured to corrupt Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale; Osburn</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> deſigned to invalidate the Evidence of Dr. <hi>Oats:</hi> But theſe ill practices being diſcovered, ſome of the perſons concerned were fined and Impriſoned, and others ſet in the Pillory; after which the Papiſts had ſeveral other Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to throw off the Plot from their own party, but all will not do; for certainly he cannot pretend to be a good Proteſtant, who (after his Majeſty's repeated Proclamations for the diſcovery and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Plotters, after the Execution of ſo many of the Conſpirators, upon the cleareſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence imaginable, and after the Votes and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in both Houſes of Parliament thereupon) ſhall in the leaſt doubt of the reality of this horrid and damnable Popiſh Plot; as it is fully expreſt in the Vote of both Houſes, <hi>March</hi> 25. 1679.</p>

            <head>Gods Judgments upon Popiſh Perſecutors, diſcovered in ſome eminent Examples.</head>
            <p n="1">1. FRom the Firſt plantation of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this Nation under King <hi>Lucius,</hi> there was never any King or Queen of <hi>England</hi> in whoſe reign ſo much Chriſtian blood was ſpilt, as in four years ſpace during the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> But as ſhe was prodigal of the Lives of the beſt of her ſubjects, and a Perſecutor of the Goſpel, ſo it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to follow her with Plagues and Judgments all her life; for nothing proſpered which ſhe took in hand, of which we ſhall give ſome few Inſtances. The faireſt and greateſt Ship ſhe had, called the <hi>Great Harry,</hi> was burnt by Lightning from Heaven, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world at that time not affording ſuch another. Then ſhe would needs marry <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> thereby Subjecting <hi>England</hi> to Strangers, yet with her utmoſt endeavour, ſhe could never ſet the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Crown on his head. Then did ſhe attempt the Reſtitution of Abby Lands, and had all the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that the Pope could give her therein, yet ſhe was utterly croſt alſo in that Deſign. Then ſhe loſt <hi>Calice</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which had been in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> during the Reign of eleven Kings, that is, from the Reign of King <hi>Edward the third;</hi> with which loſs ſhe was ſo afflicted, that ſhe told ſome of her Courtiers, <hi>If they opened her body when ſhe was dead, they would find Calice written in her heart.</hi> She was reported to be with Child, but it came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Her beloved Huſband left her, in whom ſhe placed her greateſt felicity and content. So that now ſhe could neither enjoy him, nor marry another. About the ſame time the Land was grievi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107440:106"/> afflicted with horrible Tempeſts, Famines, Plagues, mortal Diſeaſes and burning Agues, ſo that between <hi>October</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> there dyed ſeven Aldermen in <hi>London</hi> that had been Lord Maiors: and the mortality was ſo great, that much Corn was loſt in the Fields for want of men to gather it; whereby great ſcarcity enſued, and many poor people lived upon Acorns. And laſtly, ſhe was ſtruck with a lingring and pining ſickneſs, whereof ſhe dyed, having only reigned Five years and Five months, a ſhorter time than any of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> enjoyed ſince the Conqueſt, <hi>Richard</hi> the Third only excepted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the next place, let us conſider Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon ſome other Inſtruments of Cruelty; and among the reſt <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> who was a moſt Cruel Perſecutor of the Proteſtants; In King <hi>Henry the Eighths</hi> time he was a great ſtickler for the divorce from the <hi>Lady Katherine of Spain,</hi> and was therefore made Biſhop of <hi>Winchester.</hi> In King <hi>Edward the ſixths</hi> time he ſeemed a Friend to the Goſpel, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it up; but in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days he was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt inveterate enemy againſt it, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof, and continued ſo to his dying day; For the ſame day that Biſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> were burnt at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the old Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> came to dine with <hi>Gardiner:</hi> The Biſhop deferred his dinner till about four a Clock in the Afternoon, at which time came one of his Servants poſting to tell him, that fire was put to theſe Servants of God; which when he was certified of, he came out rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Duke, and ſaid, <hi>Now let us go to dinner;</hi> The Table was preſently ſet, and the Biſhop began to eat merrily, but as ſoon as he had eaten a few bits, he was on a ſudden ſtruck very ſick, and being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed from the Table to bed, he there continued in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107440:107"/> ſuch intolerable Anguiſh and Torment, that he could void nothing either by ſtool or urine. His Tongue was black and ſwoln ſo big that his mouth could not contain it, and his body violently Inflamed. In this ſad condition he lay fifteen days, and then ended his miſerable life. In the beginning of his ſickneſs, Dr. <hi>Day</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chichester</hi> coming to ſee him, began to ſpeak to him about the merciful Promiſes of God, and free Juſtification by the blood of Chriſt. To whom he anſwered, <hi>What my Lord will you open that gap now, then farewell all together; Open this window to the People, and farewell all together;</hi> And being by another Perſon put in mind of St. <hi>Peters</hi> denying his Maſter, and that he ought not to deſpair; He anſwered, I have denied Chriſt with <hi>Peter,</hi> but I never repented with <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Bloody <hi>Bonner,</hi> though he dyed in his bed, yet lay under the Spiritual Judgment of Impenitency, and as he had been a Perſecutor of the Light, and a Child of Darkneſs, ſo in darkneſs and at midnight his Carkaſs was tumbled into the Earth; And as himſelf had been a Murderer, ſo was he layd among Thieves and Murderers, a place by Gods Judgment fitly appointed for him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Dr. <hi>Whittington</hi> Chancellor having condemned a Godly Religous woman to be Burnt at <hi>Chipping Sadbury,</hi> a multitude of People came to ſee her Suffer, and among the reſt <hi>Whittington</hi> himſelf. At the ſame time there was a Butcher in another place of the Town killing a Bull, who was faſt bound with a Rope ready to be knockt on the head; the Butcher miſſing his ſtroke, the Bull broke looſe juſt as the people were coming from the Execution of this Holy Martyr; the people ſeeing him coming ſevered themſelves, and made a Lane for him, the Bull paſſed through them without hurting man,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107440:107"/> woman or child, till he came to the place where <hi>Whittington</hi> was, againſt whom he ran very furiouſly, and thruſting his Horns into his belly, ran him quite through; and tearing out his Guts with his horns, he trayl'd them about the ſtreets, to the great aſtoniſhment of thoſe that ſaw his wretched end.</p>
            <p n="5">5. One <hi>Burton</hi> Bayliff of <hi>Crowland</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> ſeemed in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixths days to be a zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proteſtant, but as ſoon as Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came to the Crown he turned Papiſt; and being forward to ſet up the Maſs, he went to Church, and the Curate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then reading the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service, he went to him and ſaid, <hi>Sirrah, will you not ſay Maſs, buckle your ſelf to it, you knave, or by Gods Blood I'le ſheath my dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in your ſhoulder;</hi> The poor Curate being affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betook himſelf to the Maſs. Shortly after this <hi>Burton</hi> and a neighbour riding together, a Crow flew over his head, and voided her Excrements upon his Noſe, which ran down his beard, and yielded ſuch an horrible ſtink, that it cauſed him to vomit in a moſt violent manner, whereupon he got home to bed, but could eat nothing, the ſtink and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting ſtill continuing, which made him with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oaths and Execrations curſe the Crow that had poiſoned him, and ſo he continued in extream pain till he dyed.</p>
